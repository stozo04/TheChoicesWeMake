Chapter 10: Shadows of a Stranger


Between the chaos of lectures and the constant hum of campus life, Andrew found solace in the cozy corner of Brewed Awakening. The rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee enveloped him as he sipped his latte, his mind wandering to thoughts of Natalie. She was returning to campus soon, and the anticipation of seeing her again made his heart race.
His eyes flicked to the clock, its steady ticking counting down the hours until he’d finally see Natalie again. But a nagging doubt crept in—what if things had changed while she was away? What if the time apart had given her clarity about Chris?
The bell above the door chimed, and Andrew's gaze snapped up, his heart skipping a beat. It wasn't Natalie—but the sight of Anna striding purposefully towards him sent a different kind of jolt through his system.
As she approached, Andrew couldn't help but notice the similarities to Natalie. God, it's uncanny, he thought. The way she moves, the set of her jaw when she's determined.
She slid into the seat across from him, ignoring the curious glances from other patrons. "Still hanging out in cafés, I see," she said, a hint of amusement in her voice.
Andrew let out a short laugh, part nervousness, part exasperation. "Well, you know me. Caffeine addict through and through." He gestured to his latte.
Anna's lips quirked up in a small smile, but it didn't reach her eyes. "Andrew, we need to talk. Seriously this time."
He leaned back, crossing his arms. "Ah, here we go. What's the crisis of the day? Alien invasion? Zombie apocalypse?"
"This isn't a game," Anna said, her voice low and intense. Her emerald eyes bored into him, making Andrew shift uncomfortably in his seat.
There it is again, Andrew mused. That look. So much like Natalie when she's dead serious about something. It's... unsettling.
He sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Look, Anna, I appreciate the whole mysterious guardian angel act, but you've got to give me something real. Who are you? How do you keep finding me?"
Anna's eyes softened, a flicker of emotion—was that pain?—crossing her face. "I wish I could just tell you everything," she murmured, almost to herself. "But that's not how this works."
"Then how does it work?" Andrew pressed, leaning forward. The buzz of the café seemed to fade away, leaving only the two of them in their own bubble of tension. "Help me understand. Please."
For a moment, it seemed Anna might actually open up. Her lips parted, eyes shimmering with unspoken words. But then, as quickly as it had appeared, the vulnerability vanished, replaced by a mask of calm resolve.
"What will it take for you to open up and trust me? Just one time?" The look of desperation crossed Anna's face. She reached across the table, her hand trembling slightly as she placed it over Andrew's. The warmth of her touch sent an unexpected jolt through him, a mix of comfort and unease.
There's something so familiar about her touch, Andrew thought, his eyes fixed on their joined hands. It's like... like I've held this hand a thousand times before.
Anna's emerald eyes bore into his, filled with an intensity that made Andrew's breath catch in his throat. "Please," she whispered, her fingers tightening ever so slightly around his. "I need you to believe me."
The café around them seemed to fade away, leaving only this moment of connection. Andrew found himself torn between the urge to pull away and the inexplicable desire to trust this mysterious girl who seemed to know so much about him.
Suddenly, a thought of Andrew's mom crossed his mind. Without really thinking, he blurted out, "I could really go for a lottery win right about now." He gave a nervous chuckle, trying to break the tension. "Give me the winning numbers, and if they match, I'll have no choice but to believe you."
Anna's expression shifted, her hand still holding his. She seemed to be weighing something heavy in her mind, her gaze never leaving Andrew's face.
After what felt like an eternity, Anna opened her bag and pulled out a piece of paper. With quick, decisive movements, she scribbled something down, then tore it off.
Holding the paper just out of Andrew's reach, she fixed him with an intense stare. "Here are next week's winning numbers. But before I give this to you, you must promise not to use them. Once the results are released, you'll see that I'm telling the truth. That's all I ask – just wait and verify."
Andrew's eyebrows shot up, a disbelieving laugh escaping his lips. "Wow! Even better than an alien invasion or zombie apocalypse!" He reached for the paper, but Anna pulled it back slightly.
"I'm serious, Andrew. Promise me."
The gravity in her voice made him pause. He searched her face, looking for any sign of deception, but found only earnest intensity.
"Alright," he said slowly. "I promise. I won't use the numbers. But if they're right..." He left the implications hanging in the air between them.
She turned to leave, but then paused, looking back at Andrew with an expression that was both sad and determined. "Andrew," she said, her voice softer now, "be patient with Natalie in the coming weeks. She's going through something big, and she'll need you to be there for her when she's ready to talk about it."
Before Andrew could process her words or ask what she meant, Anna was walking away, leaving him staring at the folded paper in his hand. He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd just set something monumental in motion. Whatever game this was, the stakes had suddenly become very, very real - and somehow, Natalie was involved too.
—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anna pushed open the café door, stepping out into the crisp autumn air. Her heart pounded in her chest as the door swung shut behind her, cutting off the warm murmur of conversations inside.
What did I just do? The thought echoed in her head, each step away from the café amplifying her anxiety. Giving him those numbers... it could change everything. What if he uses them despite his promise? What if this alters things in ways I can't predict?
She was so lost in her worried thoughts that she barely registered her surroundings. As she turned to hurry down the sidewalk, a flash of blonde hair caught her peripheral vision.
Time seemed to slow as Anna looked up, finding herself face to face with Natalie.
For a split second, their eyes met. Anna felt a jolt of recognition, of longing, of fear. She quickly averted her gaze, mumbling a hasty "Excuse me" as she brushed past Natalie and rushed away.
Oh God, Anna thought, her pace quickening as she moved down the street. She wasn't supposed to be here yet. This is all wrong.
—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Natalie's heart raced with anticipation as she approached Brewed Awakening. She'd come back to campus early, eager to surprise Andrew with her return. She knew Andrew would be at his apartment, so she thought she would stop and get his favorite cup of coffee before heading over.
The familiar scent of freshly ground beans and pastries wafted through the air as she neared the café. Natalie smiled to herself, imagining the look on Andrew's face when she showed up at his door, unexpected and bearing his favorite caramel latte.
As she reached for the door handle, movement inside the café caught her eye. She glanced through the large front window, and her heart skipped a beat. There, at their usual table, sat Andrew.
But he wasn't alone.
Across from him was a dark-haired girl Natalie had never seen before. The stranger leaned in close, her hand reaching out to touch Andrew's on the table. Even from outside, Natalie could see the intensity in the girl's emerald eyes as she spoke to Andrew.
Natalie's breath caught in her throat. She stepped closer to the window, careful to stay out of sight, her plans of surprising Andrew evaporating in an instant.
Inside, she watched as Andrew's expression shifted from skepticism to surprise. The dark-haired girl pulled out a piece of paper, scribbled something, and handed it to him. Andrew took it, his eyes wide with what looked like disbelief.
The intimacy of their interaction sent a chill through Natalie. This wasn't just a casual conversation between classmates. There was something more here, something secret and intense that made her stomach churn.
As the girl stood to leave, Natalie noticed Andrew's gaze following her, a mix of confusion and fascination on his face. He looked down at the paper in his hands, then carefully folded it and tucked it into his pocket.
Natalie stepped back from the window, her mind reeling. She'd been gone for less than a week, but suddenly it felt like she'd stepped into a different world. The distance she'd feared during her time away seemed to materialize before her eyes, taking the shape of secrets and unspoken words.
The café door opened, and Natalie found herself face to face with the dark-haired girl. For a split second, their eyes met. Natalie felt a jolt of something inexplicable - recognition? jealousy? fear? The girl quickly averted her gaze, mumbling a hasty "Excuse me" as she brushed past Natalie and hurried away.
Natalie stood frozen on the sidewalk, a strange feeling washing over her. There was something oddly familiar about the girl, but she couldn't quite place it. She turned back to the window, seeing Andrew run a hand through his hair – a gesture she knew well. It was what he did when he was deep in thought, or worried about something.
A knot formed in Natalie's stomach. The excited speech she'd prepared on her way over died on her lips as she took in the scene before her.
What had she just witnessed? Who was that girl? And why did it feel like everything had changed in the few days she'd been gone?
Natalie's hand, which had been reaching for the café door, fell back to her side. The idea of surprising Andrew with his favorite coffee now seemed naive and out of place.
Taking a deep breath, Natalie stepped back from the window. Whatever was going on, she wasn't ready to face it head-on. Not like this, not when it felt like she'd just stumbled upon something she wasn't meant to see.
With one last glance at Andrew through the window, Natalie turned and walked away. Her mind raced with questions and doubts, the knot in her stomach tightening with each step.
By the time she reached the end of the block, the words "Hey, surprise!" that she'd practiced on her way over felt like a distant memory. Instead, a single question echoed in her mind:
What had changed while she was away, and where did she fit in now?
—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The soft glow of Andrew's laptop screen illuminated his tired face as he closed yet another job listing tab. It was well past midnight, but sleep eluded him. His mind kept drifting between the pending internship decision, Anna's cryptic warnings, and most pressingly, Natalie's continued silence.
He checked his phone again. Still nothing. The silence was becoming deafening. A nagging worry grew in the pit of his stomach. Why wasn't she responding? Had something happened? Or had something changed between them without him realizing?
Andrew leaned back in his chair, rubbing his eyes. The last time he'd seen Natalie flashed in his memory – his birthday, just before she left for her family visit. The way her eyes sparkled in the candlelight, the softness of her lips against his, the warmth of her body as they lay tangled in his sheets. That night had felt like a new beginning, a step towards something deeper. Now, that memory felt like a distant dream, separated by a chasm of unanswered messages and growing doubts.
He glanced at the clock: 7:23 PM. Natalie should have been back on campus by now. He'd sent three texts and left two voicemails, each one a little more anxious than the last.
"Hey Nat, just checking in. Hope your trip went well. Can't wait to see you!"
"Natalie, give me a call when you get this, okay? Miss you."
"Is everything alright? Getting a bit worried here. Call me, please?"
Andrew ran a hand through his hair. Why wasn't she responding? Had something happened during her trip? Or was she just busy unpacking, catching up with her roommate?
He sank onto the couch, pulling out the slip of paper Anna had given him. Six numbers stared back at him, innocuous yet potentially life-changing. The lottery draw was next week. He'd promised not to play, but the temptation gnawed at him.
What if they're real? he thought for the hundredth time. What if this is the answer to everything – Mom's medical bills, my tuition, the internship...?
He folded the paper again, shoving it back into his pocket. The whole situation felt surreal. Who was Anna, really? How did she know so much about him? And why did she look so eerily like Natalie?
His phone buzzed, and he nearly dropped it in his haste to check. But it wasn't Natalie – just a reminder about his upcoming exam.
"Damn it," he muttered, tossing the phone aside. Unable to sit still with the torrent of thoughts swirling in his mind. He moved to the kitchen, opening the fridge more out of habit than hunger. His eyes fell on a photo stuck to the door – him and Natalie at the beach last summer, both laughing as waves crashed around their ankles. They looked so carefree, so happy.
"Where are you, Nat?" he whispered to the smiling face in the photo.
As if in answer, his phone chimed with a text notification. Andrew's heart leapt, but it was only Professor Mendez:
"Any word on that internship yet?"
Andrew groaned, letting his head thunk against the fridge door.With all the drama surrounding Anna and his constant worrying about Natalie, he'd nearly forgotten about it. He threw a glance at his laptop on the coffee table, fighting the urge to obsessively refresh his inbox for the hundredth time.
Instead, he found himself reaching for his phone again, thumbs hovering over the screen as he typed out another message to Natalie:
"Hey, I know you're probably tired from your trip, but I really need to talk to you. Some weird stuff happened today and... I don't know, I could use your perspective. Call me when you can, okay? I lo—"
His thumb hovered over the send button. After a moment's hesitation, he deleted the last two words. Not like this, not over text, and especially not when she wasn't even responding. He sent the message and tossed the phone back on the couch.
Only silence answered him.
—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laying in her bed,staring at the ceiling, Natalie knew sleep was a distant impossibility. Her phone lay face-down on the nightstand, Andrew's unanswered messages a constant presence in her mind. Every time she considered picking it up, the image of him with that dark-haired girl at the café flashed before her eyes, sending a fresh wave of hurt through her.
She rolled onto her side, hugging her pillow close. The last time she'd seen Andrew replayed in her mind – his birthday, the night before she left for her family visit. The way he'd looked at her during the karaoke, the feeling of rightness as they'd made love. That night felt perfect, full of promise. Now, it felt tainted by doubt. How quickly things could change, how easily misunderstandings could grow in the silence between them.
Natalie's thoughts drifted to Chris. Ending their relationship had been hard, but necessary. They'd grown apart, their goals and desires no longer aligning. She'd felt a sense of relief after the breakup, excited about the possibility of a future with Andrew.
Now, that excitement was tinged with doubt. Had she been too hasty? The image of Andrew with the mysterious dark-haired girl flashed in her mind again. What if she'd misread their entire friendship?
No, she told herself firmly. What she and Andrew had was real. It had to be. She thought of all the moments they'd shared, the deep conversations, the unspoken understanding between them. That couldn't all be in her imagination.
And yet, the seed of doubt remained, planted by what she'd seen at the café.
A wave of nausea washed over her, stronger than before. Natalie sat up slowly, taking deep breaths to quell the uneasy feeling in her stomach. This was the third time tonight. A small voice in the back of her mind whispered a possibility she wasn't ready to face.
Not now, she thought. I can't deal with that on top of everything else.
Her gaze drifted to the framed photo on her nightstand – her and Andrew junior ear showing off their class rings. They looked so carefree, so in sync. When did things become so complicated? 
Every time her phone buzzed with another message from Andrew, Natalie felt a mix of longing and apprehension. She wanted to talk to him, to clear the air, but fear held her back. What if the explanation for what she saw was worse than she imagined?
As the first light of dawn began to filter through her curtains, Natalie's finger hovered over Andrew's name in her contacts. One call could clear everything up. Or it could confirm her worst fears. The weight of unsaid words and unseen events hung between them, growing heavier with each passing moment of silence.
In the end, she set the phone back down without responding, then curled up on her side, one hand resting protectively over her stomach. Whatever the new day brought, one thing was clear – nothing would be the same again.
