Chapter 12: Natalie's Pregnancy Reveal


Professor Chen's voice faded in and out like a badly tuned radio as Natalie struggled to focus on the derivatives scratched across the whiteboard. The fluorescent lights overhead seemed impossibly bright today, each number swimming before her eyes. She'd chosen her usual seat near the window, hoping the fresh air might help, but even the gentle autumn breeze carrying the scent of fallen leaves was making her stomach turn.


Two rows ahead, someone shifted in their seat, releasing a wave of perfume - something floral and heavy. Natalie's stomach lurched. She gripped the edge of her desk, willing the wave of nausea to pass. Not here. Not now.


The world tilted slightly as she tried to copy down notes, her normally neat handwriting becoming increasingly erratic. The girl next to her - Emma? Hannah? - shot her a concerned look.


"Are you okay?" she whispered. "You look really pale."


Natalie managed a weak nod, but the movement was enough to send another wave of dizziness washing over her. The classroom suddenly felt too small, too warm, too everything. Professor Chen's voice morphed into a distant hum as blood rushed in her ears.


"The critical point occurs when..." The professor's words blurred together as Natalie's vision swam. This was different from the other moments of morning sickness. Stronger. More urgent.


No, no, no. Not in the middle of Calculus III.


She fumbled with her notebook, her hands shaking as she shoved it into her bag. The scrape of her chair against the floor seemed impossibly loud in the quiet classroom. Several heads turned her way as she stumbled to her feet.


"Miss Alexander?" Professor Chen paused mid-equation. "Is everything-"


But Natalie was already moving, practically running for the door. The hallway spun around her as she burst through it, nearly colliding with someone in her rush to find the nearest bathroom.


"Miss Thompson?" Professor Chen paused mid-equation. "Is everything-"


But Natalie was already moving, practically running for the door. The hallway spun around her as she burst through it, her hand fumbling with her phone to text Sarah while the other pressed against her mouth. 


911 bathroom. Cooper Hall. 2nd floor. Please.


The bathroom. She just needed to make it to the bathroom. Everything else - the curious stares of students in the hallway, her abandoned notebook in class, the growing certainty of what all this meant - could wait.


Just let me make it to the bathroom, she prayed silently, her footsteps echoing in the empty corridor. Please, just let me make it to the bathroom.


The cold tile pressed against her knees as Natalie hugged the toilet bowl, her whole body shaking. This was different from the other mornings - more intense, more real. Each wave of nausea seemed to wash away another layer of denial.


The sound of the bathroom door opening echoed off the walls.


"Nat?" Sarah's voice bounced against the tiles. "Your text just said '911 bathroom'."


Natalie tried to respond but another wave of sickness hit instead. The sound was enough for Sarah to find her, crumpled on the floor of the last stall.


"Oh, honey." Sarah immediately dropped her bag, kneeling beside her. Without hesitation, she gathered Natalie's hair back with one hand while dampening paper towels with the other. The cool compress against Natalie's neck brought fresh tears to her eyes - this time from gratitude.


They sat in silence until the worst passed, Sarah's steady presence a comfort in the bathroom. Finally, Natalie sat back against the wall, accepting the water bottle Sarah carried.


"So," Sarah said softly, settling beside her. "Want to tell me how long this has really been going on?"


Natalie took a small sip of water, keeping her eyes fixed on the floor. "It's nothing. Probably just a stomach bug or something."


"A stomach bug." Sarah's tone was gentle but skeptical. "The same stomach bug that made you skip breakfast three days in a row?"


"You noticed that?"


"I'm your best friend. I notice everything." Sarah paused, choosing her next words carefully. "Including how you've been wearing the same oversized sweater for two days because your regular clothes feel 'weird.'"


Fresh tears spilled down Natalie's cheeks. "Sarah..."


"Nat, honey, we need to talk about Andrew's birthday."


The words hung in the air between them, heavy with implication. Natalie pulled her knees to her chest, making herself smaller.


"I can't," she whispered. "I can't think about that night, about what it might mean, not when everything's finally..." She trailed off, remembering Andrew's smile at the bench yesterday, his words about facing whatever comes together.


"Everything's finally what? Working out?" Sarah's voice remained kind but practical. "Sweetie, you're throwing up in bathroom stalls and crying when someone walks by with coffee. We need to deal with this."


"I know." Natalie's voice cracked on the words. "I just... I thought I'd have more time. To figure things out with Andrew, to enjoy being together properly. Everything's changing so fast."


Sarah shifted closer, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. "That's what I'm here for. Whatever you need - someone to hold your hair, someone to talk to, someone to..." She let the sentence hang.


"To buy a pregnancy test?" Natalie finished in a whisper.


"Yeah. That too."


Fresh tears spilled over as Natalie leaned into her friend's embrace. "What am I going to do, Sarah?"


"First, you're going to rinse your mouth and fix your makeup." Sarah squeezed her shoulders. "Then we're going to get through this day one minute at a time. And whatever happens next, we'll figure it out together. Okay?"


Natalie nodded against Sarah's shoulder, grateful beyond words for her friend's steady presence.


"Sarah?"


"Yeah?"


"I'm scared."


Sarah pulled her closer, resting her chin on Natalie's head. "I know, honey. I know."


"Think you can stand?" Sarah asked, helping Natalie to her feet.


Natalie steadied herself against the wall, still a bit shaky but the nausea finally subsiding. "Yeah, I think so. I should probably go get my stuff from Chen's class anyway. Just left everything there when I ran out."


"Including that ridiculously expensive calculus textbook?" Sarah teased gently, keeping a supportive arm around Natalie's waist as they made their way to the sinks.


Natalie caught her reflection in the mirror - pale face, smudged mascara, hair a mess. "God, I look terrible."


"Nothing, a little water and your emergency makeup kit can't fix," Sarah pulled Natalie's small makeup bag from her purse. "Which, by the way, I grabbed from your room when I got your text. Four years of friendship - I know the drill."


As Natalie cleaned her face and reapplied her makeup, Sarah leaned against the sink counter. "Don't you usually meet Andrew for lunch on Tuesdays?"


Natalie's hands stilled, mascara wand hovering mid-air. "Yeah... in about an hour actually."


"You going to be okay for that?"


"I have to be," Natalie said, meeting Sarah's concerned gaze in the mirror. "I can't keep running away from him every time I feel sick." She attempted a weak smile. "Besides, maybe I can keep down one of those bland bagels he's always trying to get me to eat."


Sarah watched her friend carefully. "You know we need to talk about-"


"I know," Natalie cut her off. "Just... not yet. Let me get through lunch first. Let me have one normal moment with him before..." She couldn't finish the sentence.


Sarah squeezed her shoulder. "Okay. Let's go get your abandoned textbook, get some ginger ale in you, and then you can have your normal lunch moment. But after that-"


"After that, we'll deal with everything else," Natalie promised. "One thing at a time, right?"


"One thing at a time," Sarah agreed, linking her arm through Natalie's as they left the bathroom. "Starting with rescuing your three-hundred-dollar textbook from Chen's classroom."


Professor Chen's classroom was empty when they returned, the equations still sprawled across the whiteboard, the only evidence of the interrupted lecture. Natalie's notebook lay open on her desk, hurried scribbles trailing off mid-sentence.


"Well, if it isn't Miss Alexander," Professor Chen looked up from his desk, his expression concerned rather than annoyed. "Feeling better?"


"Yes, sir. I'm so sorry about running out like that." Natalie felt her cheeks flush as she gathered her things.


He waved off her apology. "Not the first time a student's made a quick exit, won't be the last. Just make sure to get today's notes from someone." 


As they left the classroom "Sarah," Natalie stopped walking, turning to face her friend. "Thank you. For everything today. For always."


Sarah pulled her into a quick hug. "That's what best friends are for. Now go meet Andrew, while I go convince Manning that projectile vomiting is a valid reason to miss his pop quiz."


Natalie managed a genuine laugh. "My hero."


"Just..." Sarah's voice turned serious. "Text me after lunch? We still need to..."


"I know." Natalie squeezed her hand. "I promise. After lunch."


As Sarah headed off to her next class, Natalie took a deep breath, straightened her shoulders, and started walking toward the café where she and Andrew always met for lunch. One thing at a time, she reminded herself. Just like Sarah said.


One thing at a time.




The campus café was busy with the usual lunch rush, but Andrew was already at their usual corner table, two drinks in front of him. Her heart did a little flip when she saw what they were - a coffee for him, and a ginger ale for her. He must have noticed how pale she'd been earlier.


"Hey," she said softly, sliding into the seat across from him.


Andrew looked up, relief washing over his features. "Hey yourself." He pushed the ginger ale toward her. "Thought you might need this."


"Thanks." Their fingers brushed as she took the drink, sending that familiar spark through her even now. "


They fell into a comfortable silence, Andrew watching her with soft concern as she nibbled at the crackers he'd also thought to get her. The afternoon sun streaming through the window caught his eyes, turning them that warm honey color she loved.


"You know," he said suddenly, a slight nervousness creeping into his voice. "We should probably do this properly."


"Do what properly?"


"This." He gestured between them, a shy smile playing at his lips. "Us. I mean, we've done everything backwards, haven't we? Years of friendship, that night on my birthday, all these lunches..." He ran a hand through his hair - that nervous gesture she knew so well. "What I'm trying to say is... I'd really like to take you on an actual date. Our first official date."


The sincerity in his voice made her throat tight. "Yeah?"


"Yeah." His smile grew more confident. "There's this little Italian place off campus. Family owned, string lights in the garden, real tablecloths - the whole nine yards. I've been wanting to take you there for... well, longer than I probably should admit."




Natalie felt tears threatening - happy ones this time, though lately all her emotions seemed tangled together. "How long?" she asked, managing a teasing smile.


"Remember that day last semester when you were stressed about finals? You said you'd kill for real Italian food, not dining hall pasta." He looked down, almost shy. "I looked up the restaurant that night. Been keeping it in my back pocket ever since."


"That was months ago."


"Yeah, well." He reached across the table, taking her hand. "I've been crazy about you for a lot longer than that."


The simple honesty in his words made her heart ache. Here he was, planning their first real date, being so perfectly Andrew about everything, while she sat on the biggest secret of their lives.


"Friday?" he asked, his thumb tracing circles on her palm. "I could pick you up at seven?"


"Friday sounds perfect," she managed, hoping he couldn't feel her hand trembling.


The rest of lunch passed in a comfortable blur - Andrew telling her about his morning classes, and his anticipation to hear back from the internship project. When they finally had to leave, he pulled her into a gentle hug.


"You sure you're feeling okay?" he murmured into her hair.


She nodded against his chest, memorizing this moment - his steady heartbeat, the familiar scent of his cologne, the way his arms felt like home. "Just a stomach bug or something."


"Text me if you need anything?" 


"I will." She stepped back, forcing a smile. "See you tomorrow?"


He pressed a kiss to her forehead. "Can't wait."


Natalie watched him walk away, her heart heavy with everything unsaid. When he disappeared around the corner, she pulled out her phone with shaking hands.


To Sarah: Lunch over. Let's do this..


The response was immediate: My room. 15 minutes. Bringing supplies.


Natalie took a deep breath, touching her forehead where Andrew's kiss still lingered. Time to face what she'd been trying so hard to deny.


Sarah's "supplies" turned out to be a CVS bag, a pint of mint chocolate chip ice cream, and tissues. She'd also grabbed Natalie's favorite blanket from her room, transforming the sterile bathroom into something almost comforting.


"Okay," Sarah said, pulling out the pregnancy test. "The pharmacist said this is the most accurate one for early detection."


Natalie stared at the pink box, her lunch with Andrew still fresh in her mind. His sweet smile as he talked about the Italian restaurant, how long he'd been waiting to take her there...


"Nat?" Sarah's voice broke through her thoughts. "We don't have to do this right now if you're not ready."


"No, I need to know." Natalie took the box with trembling hands. "I can't... I can't go on that date Friday still wondering. It's not fair to either of us."


Sarah squeezed her shoulder. "Whatever happens, you know I'm here, right?"


Natalie nodded, unable to speak. The test felt impossibly heavy in her hands.


"Three minutes," Sarah said softly, setting a timer on her phone. "That's all. Three minutes and we'll know."


Natalie slowly closed the door, her heart pounding so loud she was sure Sarah could hear it. The instructions blurred as she read them, her hands shaking so badly she almost dropped the test.


When she emerged, Sarah was waiting with open arms. They sank down against the wall together, the cold tile a stark contrast to the warmth of Sarah's supportive embrace.


"Talk to me," Sarah whispered as the seconds ticked by. "What are you thinking?"


"He's been planning this date for months," Natalie's voice cracked. "Since before his birthday, before everything changed. He looked so happy talking about it, about finally taking me to this perfect little restaurant, and all I could think was..." She pressed her hands to her stomach, the reality of what they were waiting for hitting her all over again.






"He looked so excited about the string lights in the garden," Natalie continued, tears falling freely now. "Who even notices things like that? But that's Andrew, isn't it? Always thinking about the little details that would make me happy."


Sarah held her tighter as the timer on her phone continued its silent countdown. "That's not going to change, Nat. Whatever this test says, that boy is crazy about you."


"But everything else will change." Natalie wiped her eyes. "My parents, school, his mom being sick... we just finally got everything right, Sarah. The timing was finally perfect and now-"


The phone buzzed.


Both girls froze.


"Do you want me to look?" Sarah asked softly.


Natalie shook her head. With trembling hands, she reached for the test she'd placed on paper towels beside them. The world seemed to narrow down to this moment - the cold tile beneath her, Sarah's steady presence beside her, and two lines that would change everything.


She turned the test over.


For a moment, she just stared, unable to process what she was seeing. The room felt too small, too large, too everything all at once.


"Nat?" Sarah's voice seemed to come from far away.


"I-" Natalie's voice caught. She tried again. "It's positive."


The word hung in the air between them, making it real in a way that morning sickness and missed periods hadn't. Positive. She was pregnant. With Andrew's baby. While he planned string-lit dinners and first dates and everything they should have had time for.


"Oh, honey." Sarah pulled her close as the sobs finally came, great heaving cries that seemed to come from somewhere deep inside.


Through her tears, Natalie could see her phone screen light up with a text. Andrew.


Can't stop thinking about Friday. Already made reservations. 


Fresh tears spilled over as Sarah quickly moved the phone out of sight. Natalie curled into her friend's embrace, the test still clutched in her hand, her world simultaneously expanding and contracting around two pink lines that changed everything.


"Sarah?" she whispered between sobs.


"Yeah?"


"What am I going to do?"


Sarah stroked her hair, letting her cry. "We'll figure it out. Whatever you need, whatever you decide. We'll figure it out together."


Outside their bubble in the bathroom, life went on. Students passed in the hallway, laughing and chatting. The afternoon sun slanted through the high window, casting long shadows on the floor. And somewhere across campus, a boy planned a perfect first date, unaware that their story had already taken an unexpected turn.
