Chapter 16: The Lottery


The campus felt different in the evening quiet, streetlights casting long shadows across empty walkways. Andrew's footsteps echoed against brick buildings as he left his late programming class, his mind still spinning from the past few days.


Becoming a father. The words still caught in his throat every time he thought them. The memory of his mother's joy when they told her made his heart ache - how she'd cried happy tears over the phone, already planning what the baby would call her, trying so hard to sound strong. His grandfather's reaction had been pure him - first a long whistle, then that deep belly laugh before declaring, "Well, kid, guess those programming genes of yours work just fine!" Leave it to Grandpa to break the tension with his goofy humor while somehow still conveying all the pride and love behind it. Natalie's parents' mix of shock and cautious excitement.


Then today's appointment - seeing their baby on the screen, hearing the heartbeat. Real and solid and terrifying and wonderful all at once. Natalie squeezing his hand so tight while the doctor confirmed everything looked perfect, right on schedule.


His mom's voice from their phone call last night echoed in his mind - how she'd tried to sound upbeat about the latest treatment costs, but he'd heard the worry she was trying to hide. "Just focus on school, honey," she'd said, but he'd overheard her conversation with the insurance company before she realized he was still on the line. $47,892 for just one treatment. 


He'd been so caught up in it all, he'd almost forgotten about the internship. Almost. The email from Professor Mendez sat unopened in his inbox: "When you're ready to discuss alternative opportunities..." 


His feet carried him down the familiar path, past the library where he and Natalie had spent countless study sessions, past Brewed Awakening where she still couldn't stand the smell of coffee. The morning sickness was better, she claimed, but he noticed how she still avoided certain foods, certain smells.


Their bench came into view, and Andrew found himself slowing. The carved initials caught the lamplight - "A&N" - permanent and unchanging while everything else shifted around them. He traced the letters with his finger, smiling despite his exhaustion. Who would have thought a simple carving could witness so much? Their friendship, their love, their future taking shape in ways he never could have imagined.


"Soon there'll be three of us," he murmured to the quiet night, his other hand absently patting his wallet where a forgotten lottery ticket waited to change everything. Again.

A newspaper slapped against his chest, startling him. "What have you done?" Anna's voice cracked with raw emotion. He'd never seen her like this - her usual composed demeanor completely shattered, hands trembling, eyes wild with something that looked like fear.


Everything could unravel now, she thought, panic rising in her chest. All the careful planning, all the precise moments, all of it balanced on the edge of a knife. I was supposed to protect him, guide him. How did I let this happen?


"I thought you promised me," her voice broke as tears began to roll down her cheeks.


He caught the paper before it fell, the headline jumping out at him: "RECORD LOTTERY WIN - MYSTERY WINNER YET TO CLAIM PRIZE"


"The ticket?" Andrew blinked, confused. "I haven't even-"


"Don't!" She cut him off, actually stamping her foot in frustration. "Those were the exact numbers I gave you. The ones you promised not to use!" Her hands raked through her hair as she paced, muttering words that seemed meant more for herself than him. "This isn't right. This isn't how it's supposed to go. Everything's wrong, all wrong."


"Anna, I swear, I haven't-" He reached for his wallet with shaking hands, pulling out the crumpled ticket. "Look, it's still here. I haven't even..."


His voice trailed off as he looked at the numbers, then at the paper. The world seemed to shift under their feet.


"Check it." Her demand came out like a plea, her emerald eyes filling with fresh tears. "Check it right now." Please, she thought, let me be wrong. Let this be salvageable.


Andrew pulled out his phone. Anna held her breath, her entire being focused on this moment. Everything she'd worked for, everything she'd tried to prevent or protect, hanging by a thread.


First number matched. Then the second. Third. Fourth.


The newspaper slipped from his grasp.


Fifth. Sixth.


"Oh god," he whispered.


"You can't claim this ticket, Andrew." Anna's voice was thick with desperation. "You have to get rid of it. The consequences..." She wrapped her arms around herself as if fighting off a chill. "They're too severe. Too far-reaching. You have no idea what claiming this could do."


Andrew looked up sharply. The plane crash flashed through his mind - the flight he should have been on, the choice that saved his life. Had it really been his choice? Or had Anna somehow known, guided him? For the first time, he really looked at her, really listened.


"You knew about the crash, didn't you?" His voice was barely a whisper. "Just like you knew about these numbers."


"You're finally listening to me." A sad smile crossed her face. "You made the right choice that day, Andrew. And now..." She took a shaky breath. "Now this choice is just as critical. Maybe more so."


"But the money - my mom's medical bills, the baby's future..."


"Some prices are too high," she cut him off. "Please. Trust me."


The intensity in her eyes made his chest tight. Whatever was happening here, whatever Anna knew that he didn't, it was bigger than lottery tickets and lucky numbers.


"What are you?" he asked softly. "How do you know these things?" He stared at the ticket, then back at his phone, re-confirming the matching numbers as if they might somehow change.


When he looked up again, noticing the oddly quiet park, she was gone. Only the fallen newspaper remained as proof she'd been there at all.


Standing alone by their bench, their carved initials watching silently, Andrew realized the hardest choice still lay ahead.
