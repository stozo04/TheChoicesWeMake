Chapter 15: Truths Revealed


Natalie hunched over the toilet, grateful that Sarah had not already left for class. The morning sun streamed through the small bathroom window, making the tile floor glow as another wave of nausea hit her.


"Here." Sarah's voice was gentle as she pressed a cool washcloth to the back of Natalie's neck. "Better?"


Natalie nodded weakly, sitting back against the wall. "Some morning sickness. More like all-day sickness."


"You have to tell him, Nat." Sarah sat beside her, their shoulders touching. "Especially after last night. God, when that news report came on about the crash..."


"I know." Natalie's hand instinctively moved to her stomach. "I almost lost him before he even knew he was going to be a father. How crazy is that? He skipped that flight because of a pretzel sign, of all things."


Sarah squeezed her hand. "Maybe it wasn't just the sign. Maybe something bigger was at work."


Natalie's phone buzzed on the counter. She reached for it, a small smile forming despite her queasiness.


"Andrew?" Sarah asked.


"Yeah. He's bringing me coffee before his meeting with Professor Mendez." Natalie let out a weak laugh. "Coffee. The smell alone makes me sick now."


"Perfect timing to tell him then." Sarah stood, pulling Natalie up with her. "When he realizes you're turning down caffeine, he'll know something's definitely up."


Natalie moved to the sink, splashing water on her face and trying to make herself look less pale. The pregnancy test sat on the counter, still in its envelope - such a small thing to hold such life-changing news.


"What if he's not ready?" The words came out barely above a whisper. "We just finally got everything right. The internship thing, that girl at the café... we just got through all that."


"Nat." Sarah turned her friend to face her. "That man chose you over his dream job. He skipped a flight - thank god - to take you on a date. And have you seen the way he looks at you? Like you're his whole world?"


Tears welled in Natalie's eyes. "I'm scared, Sarah."


"I know." Sarah pulled her into a hug. "But you can't keep carrying this alone. Especially not after last night. Some things are too big to face by yourself."


Natalie's phone buzzed again:


"Meeting you at our park in 30. Bringing your favorite caramel latte! ❤️"


She stared at the message, one hand still pressed to her stomach, the other clutching the envelope with the ultrasound.


"You're right," she said finally, straightening her shoulders. "It has to be today."


Sarah smiled, handing her friend a tissue. "Want me to walk you there?"


Natalie shook her head, tucking the envelope into her purse. "No. This is something I need to do alone." She managed a small smile. "But maybe stay close to your phone?"


"Always." Sarah hugged her one more time. "It's going to be okay, Nat. Better than okay."


As Natalie gathered her things to leave, she caught her reflection in the mirror - pale but determined. In a few hours, everything would change. Again. But this time, the change felt right. Necessary. Like coming home.


"Here goes nothing," she whispered to her reflection, and headed out to meet Andrew.




The morning air was crisp as Natalie approached their bench at the park, autumn leaves crunching under her feet. Her fingers found the carved initials automatically, tracing the familiar grooves of "A&N" as she sat down. The simple act calmed her racing heart, if only slightly.


She spotted Andrew before he saw her - walking across the quad with two coffee cups, his face brightening the moment he caught sight of her. The same look he'd given her last night at the restaurant, right before the news about the crash. The look that said she was his whole world.


"Morning, beautiful." He held out her cup with a grin. "One caramel latte for my favorite person."


The smell hit her immediately, her stomach lurching. She pushed his hand away gently. "I... actually can't."


Andrew's brow furrowed with concern. "Still not feeling well? That bug's really hanging on." He set both cups aside, placing the back of his hand against her forehead. "Maybe we should get you to the doctor-"


"I already went to the doctor," she interrupted softly.


Something in her tone made him pause. She watched as different emotions crossed his face - confusion, concern, the beginning of understanding.


"Nat?" His voice was gentle, questioning.


Her hands trembled as she reached for her purse. "Remember yesterday, at the restaurant, before... before the news about the crash? I was trying to tell you something."


Andrew sat beside her, his hand finding hers where it rested on their carved initials. "Tell me what?"


"You said you felt like you were about to miss something important." She pulled out the envelope, her heart pounding so hard she was sure he could hear it. "You weren't wrong."


The envelope shook slightly as she held it out to him. Andrew took it carefully, as if sensing its importance. For a moment, they both just stared at it, sitting there between them on their bench.


"Open it," she whispered.


Andrew's fingers moved to the flap, and Natalie held her breath. Everything was about to change - again. But this time, the change wouldn't come from a broken pretzel sign or a crashed plane. This time, the change was growing inside her, waiting to be known.


Time seemed to slow as Andrew pulled out the ultrasound photo. At first, he just stared at it, his expression unreadable. Then his eyes widened, darting from the image to her face and back again.


"Nat..." His voice cracked. "Is this... are you..."


She nodded, tears already forming. "I'm pregnant, Andrew."


The photo trembled in his hands. "How long have you..."


"I found out right after I saw you with Anna at the café," she admitted softly. "I was coming to surprise you that day, to tell you about ending things with Chris, and then..." She took a shaky breath. "Everything happened so fast after that."


Understanding dawned in his eyes. "The stomach bug. It wasn't-"


"Morning sickness," she confirmed. "Though whoever named it that clearly never experienced it themselves."


Andrew's free hand moved hesitantly toward her stomach, pausing just inches away. Natalie took his hand and pressed it gently against her still-flat abdomen.


"I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner," she whispered. "I wanted to so many times. Last night at dinner, when we heard about the crash, I realized I couldn't wait anymore. I almost lost you before you even knew you were going to be a father."


"A father," he repeated, the words seeming to echo between them. Then, suddenly, he pulled her into his arms, and she felt wetness on her shoulder - he was crying.


"We're having a baby?" His voice was filled with wonder and disbelief.


She nodded against his chest, her own tears falling freely now. "We're having a baby."


He pulled back just enough to look at her, his eyes shining. "I love you," he said fiercely. "Both of you. God, Natalie, when I think about that flight... about what I almost..."


"But you didn't," she reminded him, touching his face. "You're here. We're here."


Andrew looked down at the ultrasound photo again, a smile breaking through his tears. "Is everything okay? With the baby? With you? You've been so sick-"


"Everything's perfect," she assured him. "Doctor says it's all normal. Even the ridiculous aversion to coffee."


He laughed softly, then sobered. "That's why you've been avoiding the café."


"Hard to keep down breakfast when someone three tables over orders a latte."


His arm tightened around her protectively. "You should have told me. You didn't have to go through this alone."


"I wasn't alone," Natalie said softly. "Sarah's been amazing. But you're right, I should have told you sooner. I was just... scared."


"Of what?" His thumb traced circles on her stomach, a gesture that already felt natural.


"Of everything changing. Again." She looked down at their joined hands. "We just got us figured out, and then this happened, and you had the internship opportunity..."


"Hey." He tilted her chin up gently. "Nothing is more important than this. Than us. I mean, I gave up that internship for a pretzel sign." His grin was contagious. "Pretty sure I can handle becoming a dad."


"A dad," she repeated, watching his smile grow wider at the word.


"You know what's crazy?" He glanced down at their carved initials, his free hand tracing the familiar grooves. "Yesterday I thought choosing to skip that flight was the biggest decision of my life. Turns out it wasn't even the biggest news of the week."


Natalie laughed, then suddenly pressed a hand to her mouth.


"Morning sickness?" Andrew asked, concern flooding his features.


She nodded, already standing. "Sorry, romantic moment is over. I need to-"


"Come on." He wrapped an arm around her waist, supporting her. "My apartment's closer than yours. You can rest there, and we can talk about..." He grinned again, "everything."


As they walked slowly across campus, Andrew's arm never leaving her waist, Natalie felt a peace she hadn't known in weeks. No more secrets. No more hiding morning sickness. No more carrying this alone.


"We should probably tell our parents," she mused, leaning into him.


"Probably," he agreed. "But maybe we can just have today? Just us?"


She smiled, remembering Sarah's words from earlier. Some things were too big to face alone. But this? This moment right here? This was perfect just for them.


If only she'd known then that this wouldn't be the only life-changing revelation of the weekend.
