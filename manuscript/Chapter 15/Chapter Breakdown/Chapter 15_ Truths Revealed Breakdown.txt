Would you like me to:
1. Develop any scene in more detail
2. Write out specific dialogue
3. Enhance particular emotional moments
4. Show how it connects to surrounding chapters


This chapter should:
- Give weight to pregnancy reveal
- Show their relationship deepening
- Create natural flow between crash and lottery chapters
- Build emotional resonance


How would you like to proceed?
