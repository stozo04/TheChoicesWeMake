Chapter 11: Bridges Burn and Built
Natalie stared at the ceiling of her dorm room, the soft glow of the morning sun seeping through the gaps in her curtains. She hadn't slept well, her mind a turbulent sea of emotions since that fateful afternoon at Brewed Awakenings. The image of Andrew sitting with that girl kept replaying in her head like a cruel, endless loop.


She rolled over, burying her face in her pillow as a wave of nausea washed over her. For the past few days, she'd been feeling off—tired, queasy, and more emotional than usual. It's just stress, she told herself, pushing away the nagging voice in the back of her mind that whispered of other possibilities.


A soft knock at her door broke through her reverie. "Nat? You up?" Sarah's voice called out, gentle but probing.


Natalie sighed, pulling herself into a sitting position. "Yeah, come in," she replied, her voice rougher than she expected.


Sarah slipped into the room, her brow furrowed with concern as she took in Natalie's disheveled appearance. "You look like hell, girl. Have you even left this room since yesterday?"


Natalie shook her head, a humorless chuckle escaping her lips. "What's the point? I can't go home again—I was just there last week. And I can't face..." She trailed off, unable to say his name.


Sarah sat on the edge of the bed, reaching out to squeeze Natalie's hand. "You can't avoid Andrew forever, you know. Have you even talked to him since you saw him with that girl?"


"No," Natalie admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. "I just... I can't. Every time I think about calling him, I see them together, and it's like a knife twisting in my gut."


Sarah's eyes softened with understanding. "Nat, you're overthinking this. Andrew is head over heels for you—anyone can see that. How do you know they weren't just talking about a school project or something?"


Natalie wanted to believe her friend's words, but doubt had taken root in her heart. "You didn't see them, Sarah. The way they were leaning in, how intense their conversation looked. And why wouldn't he have mentioned her to me before?"


"Maybe because there's nothing to mention?" Sarah suggested gently. "Look, I get why you're upset, but you can't jump to conclusions. You need to talk to him, hear his side of the story."


Natalie nodded slowly, knowing Sarah was right but feeling the weight of her emotions pressing down on her. "I know, I know. It's just... it's not just about Andrew and that girl. I've been feeling so off lately, and seeing them together, it's like it brought everything crashing down."


Sarah's brow furrowed deeper. "What do you mean, feeling off?"


Natalie hesitated, then decided to confide in her friend. "I've been really tired, and nauseous, and... I don't know, just not myself. I thought it was stress from everything with Chris and then seeing Andrew, but..."


She didn't finish the sentence, but understanding dawned in Sarah's eyes. "Nat, do you think...?"


Natalie shook her head vehemently. "No, no. It can't be that. It's just stress. It has to be."


Sarah squeezed her hand again. "Okay, let's not jump to any conclusions there either. One thing at a time. First, you need to talk to Andrew. Clear the air. Then we can deal with... whatever else might be going on. Okay?"


Natalie took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. "Okay," she agreed, her voice small but determined. "I'll talk to him."


As Sarah pulled her into a comforting hug, Natalie closed her eyes, trying to summon the courage she'd need to face Andrew and the truth—whatever it might be.
The following afternoon, Natalie found herself trudging across campus, her backpack feeling heavier than usual. She'd barely slept the night before, tossing and turning as her conversation with Sarah played on repeat in her mind. The logical part of her knew Sarah was right—she needed to talk to Andrew. But every time she reached for her phone, a wave of nausea washed over her, and she couldn't tell if it was from anxiety or... something else.
As she approached the park that bordered the east side of campus, Natalie paused, closing her eyes against a sudden spell of dizziness. Just stress, she told herself again, though the words were beginning to ring hollow. When she opened her eyes, her gaze was drawn to a familiar spot—their bench near the duck pond.
Her heart skipped a beat as she saw Andrew sitting there, hunched over with his head bowed. She was too far to make out his expression, but something in his posture spoke of deep distress. As she watched, his hand moved slowly across the wooden slats of the bench.
Drawn by an invisible pull, Natalie moved closer. She could see now what Andrew was doing—his finger was tracing over something carved into the bench. Even from a distance, she knew what it was: "A&N", their initials that they had playfully etched there years ago.
The sight of Andrew, shoulders shaking slightly as he traced their intertwined initials, made Natalie's throat tighten with emotion. All the anger and hurt she'd been nursing suddenly seemed trivial in the face of Andrew's obvious pain.
"Andrew?" she called softly as she approached, not wanting to startle him.
He looked up, hastily wiping at his eyes, but not before Natalie caught sight of the tears on his cheeks. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the air heavy with unspoken words.
"Natalie," he finally said, his voice rough. "I... I didn't expect to see you here."
She sat down beside him, her eyes drawn to the "A&N" carved into the bench between them. She reached out, her fingers hovering over the etching but not quite touching it. "I was on my way to class, but..." she trailed off, gesturing vaguely at him. "Andrew, what's wrong? What happened?"
He let out a shaky laugh that held no humor, his own hand coming to rest near the carving, not quite touching hers. "What hasn't happened? My mom's sick, Natalie. Really sick. And this internship I was counting on? Radio silence. And then there's us..." He looked at her, his eyes filled with a mix of longing and uncertainty. "You've been distant lately. I've been trying to reach you, but it feels like you're avoiding me. Did I do something wrong?"
Natalie felt a pang of guilt, realizing Andrew had no idea why she'd been avoiding him. She took a deep breath, steeling herself. "Andrew, I... I saw you at Brewed Awakenings the other day. With a girl. You seemed... close."
Andrew's brow furrowed in confusion for a moment before understanding dawned on his face. "You mean Anna? Natalie, it's not what you think. She's... it's complicated."
"Complicated how?" Natalie asked, trying to keep the hurt out of her voice.
Andrew ran a hand through his hair, clearly struggling to find the words. "She keeps showing up, out of nowhere, with these cryptic messages. I don't even know her, not really. But every time she appears, she says something... strange. Like ‘I am here to help you Andrew’"
Natalie stared at him, her heart torn between disbelief and the desire to trust him. Andrew had always been terrible at lying. He wore his heart on his sleeve, even when it hurt him. Could he really be making this up? She wanted to scoff, to walk away, but something stopped her.
"What does she want to help with?" she asked, her voice quieter now, the anger starting to ebb.
Andrew met her gaze, his voice soft, raw. "She told me to be patient. That you were going through something, something big. And that I needed to be here for you when you were ready to talk about it. - I just assumed it was with you and Chris."
Natalie felt something inside her break. The tears she'd been fighting back started falling freely. "Andrew, put yourself in my shoes for just one minute!" Her voice cracked with emotion. "I was driving back to campus - back to you - after finally, finally ending things with Chris. Do you know how hard that was? I chose you! After all this time, all the confusion, I chose you!"
She wrapped her arms around herself, her whole body shaking. "And then... then I see you sitting there, so close to her, looking at her like... like..." She couldn't finish, the memory still too raw. "God, do you know what that did to me? What that felt like?"
Andrew stood frozen, his eyes widening as the weight of her words hit him. Tears began forming in his own eyes as he watched the woman he loved break down in front of him, knowing he was the cause of her pain. Each sob felt like a knife to his heart.
"And now," Natalie continued, her voice barely a whisper, "now I finally get the courage to confront you, and you're telling me these wild stories about some mysterious girl with messages? How am I supposed to believe that, Andrew? How?"
Andrew couldn't stand the distance between them anymore. With trembling hands, he gently cupped her face, his thumbs wiping away her tears even as his own fell. His voice was thick with emotion when he spoke.
"Natalie, I love you," he said, the words rushing out like a confession he couldn't hold back anymore. "I have loved you from the day I met you. Please," his voice cracked, "please believe me. I would never, never do anything to hurt you intentionally. You have to know that."
Natalie stared into his eyes, seeing her own tears reflected in his. For a moment, she was completely still, caught between the hurt that had been consuming her and the sincerity in his voice that she'd always trusted. Her hands moved up to cover his where they still cradled her face.
"I want to believe you," she whispered, her voice trembling. "God, Andrew, I want to believe you so badly it hurts."
Andrew pressed his forehead against hers, their tears mingling. "Then believe me," he breathed. "Because everything - every moment, every laugh, every stupid joke I've ever told just to see you smile - it's all been real. You're the only thing that's ever been real to me, Natalie."
She closed her eyes, feeling the warmth of his touch, the familiar scent of his cologne mixing with the crisp autumn air around them. The world seemed to narrow down to just this moment, just them.
"I broke up with Chris because my heart has always been here," she admitted softly. "Even when I didn't want to admit it. Even when I was too scared to face it."
Andrew pulled back slightly, just enough to meet her eyes. The intensity in his gaze made her breath catch. "Then let's stop being scared," he said. "Let's figure out whatever this is with Anna together. Because the only thing I know for certain is that I don't want to spend another day with you thinking I could ever want anyone else."
Natalie felt something shift inside her - like puzzle pieces finally clicking into place. The hurt wasn't gone, and the questions about Anna still lingered in the air between them, but for the first time since she'd seen them at the coffee shop, she felt like she could breathe again.
She nodded slowly, a small smile breaking through her tears. "Together," she repeated, the word both a promise and a question.
"Together," Andrew confirmed, pulling her into his arms, holding her like he never intended to let go.
Above them, the setting sun painted the sky in shades of pink and gold, casting long shadows across the campus grounds. And somewhere, in the growing darkness, a figure watched from afar, a knowing smile playing on her lips as she whispered, "Now it begins."
