Chapter 14: The Flight That Never Was


Andrew drummed his fingers against his laptop case, watching dark clouds gather outside the terminal windows. 5:47 AM. Still plenty of time before his 7:00 AM flight, but the weather wasn't looking promising. Other passengers huddled around charging stations and coffee kiosks, their hushed conversations about the approaching storm creating a low hum of anxiety throughout the gate area.


He pulled out his phone, thumb hovering over Natalie's last text:
"Have a safe flight! Can't wait to hear all about it when you get back. PS: Don't forget to eat something before boarding 💕"


A smile tugged at his lips. Even through text, she was taking care of him. He started typing a response when the overhead speakers crackled to life.


"Attention passengers of Flight 887 with service to Austin, Texas." The announcement already carried that apologetic tone that made his stomach sink. "Due to severe weather conditions affecting the region, your flight has been delayed. The new estimated departure time is 8:30 am. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding."


A collective groan rose from the waiting area. Andrew leaned back in his chair, watching rain begin to streak across the massive windows. Ninety minutes. He could have had another hour with Natalie this morning instead of rushing to beat traffic.


The thought caught him off guard. He should be worried about being late to orientation, about making a bad first impression. Instead, all he could think about was how quiet Natalie had seemed lately, how something felt off despite her constant support. That familiar crease between her eyebrows meant she was keeping something to herself. 


Andrew's phone buzzed - a weather alert warning of severe storms moving through the area. He opened his messages again, scrolling through his conversation with Natalie. Something about her last few texts felt... different. Like she was trying to tell him something between the lines.


Anna's words echoed in his mind: "The choices you make will change everything."


He shook his head, trying to clear it. No more cryptic warnings. No more mysteries. This was his future - this internship, this opportunity. Even if it meant postponing their first real date. Even if it meant ignoring that nagging feeling that he was missing something important.


Thunder rolled again, closer this time. The rain came down harder, turning the world outside into a gray blur. Somewhere in that storm was Natalie, probably just waking up, maybe fighting that stomach bug again...


His stomach growled, interrupting his thoughts. Right. Natalie's reminder to eat. He gathered his things, deciding to explore the terminal for breakfast options. Maybe food would help clear his head, help him focus on what really mattered.


The irony of that thought would hit him later.


The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as Andrew wandered deeper into the terminal, his carry-on wheels clicking against the tile floor. Gate numbers counted down like a backward timer as he passed shuttered shops and drowsy travelers. His mind kept drifting back to Natalie's texts, to that feeling that something was left unsaid.


The smell of cinnamon and butter cut through his thoughts. Up ahead, a pretzel shop's warm light spilled into the corridor, a beacon in the sterile airport environment. As he approached, the neon sign caught his attention: "ANN'S PRETZELS."


He watched as the third 'N' flickered once, twice, then went dark.


"AN PRETZELS"


Andrew stopped dead in his tracks. A&N. Just like their carved initials on the bench. Just like yesterday, when Natalie's fingers had been tracing those letters over and over while he told her about postponing their date.


The sign flickered again, as if emphasizing the point. AN. Andrew and Natalie. 


"The signs are all around you, if you'd only pay attention." Anna's words from yesterday floated back, carrying new weight.


He let out a short laugh, running a hand through his hair. "Great. Now I'm getting life advice from a broken pretzel sign."


But he couldn't shake the feeling. First the storm, then the delay, and now this? The universe seemed to be trying awfully hard to tell him something.


Lightning flashed outside the terminal windows, illuminating the darkened "N" for a split second. Thunder followed immediately, making several nearby passengers jump.


Andrew stared at the sign, at those two letters that had followed him through his entire relationship with Natalie. On carved into their bench, on the bridge at the art walki... and now here, glowing in neon while his flight to his supposed dream job sat grounded by storms.


The pretzel shop worker caught his eye through the window, gesturing at the fresh batch she was pulling from the oven. The warm, homey smell wafted toward him again, reminding him of Sunday mornings studying with Natalie, sharing pretzels from the campus café.


His hands tightened on his laptop bag. "Listen to your heart," Anna had said. Was this what she meant? Was he really considering throwing away the internship opportunity of a lifetime because of a broken sign and some rain?


But even as he thought it, he knew this wasn't about pretzels or signs or storms. This was about that look in Natalie's eyes lately. About the way she'd held onto him a little longer when saying goodbye yesterday. About that feeling that something big was happening, something he was missing while he chased his carefully planned future.


The "N" flickered one more time before going completely dark, leaving those two letters glowing steady and clear.


AN.


Sometimes the biggest signs come in the smallest moments.


Twenty minutes later, Andrew stood at the convenience store counter near the airport exit, a bouquet of mixed flowers in one hand and a bottle of champagne in the other. His carry-on leaned against his leg, his decision still sending adrenaline through his system.


"Big plans?" the cashier asked, scanning the items.


"Yeah," Andrew smiled, reaching for his wallet. "Making up for almost making a huge mistake."


As he pulled out his credit card, a folded piece of paper fluttered to the floor. He recognized it immediately - Anna's lottery numbers, still crisp despite living in his wallet for days. He'd almost forgotten about them.


"Oh hey," the cashier's eyes lit up, nodding toward the massive lottery billboard visible through the store window. "Speaking of huge mistakes, you buying a ticket? Biggest jackpot in state history. Drawing's tonight."


Andrew picked up the fallen paper, Anna's neat handwriting staring back at him. Another one of her warnings. Another sign?


"The choices you make will change everything."


The cashier waited expectantly. "Last chance before the drawing. What do you say?"


Andrew looked at the numbers again, remembering Anna's intensity when she'd given them to him. "You must promise not to use them," she'd said. But that was before. Before the storms, before the delays, before a broken pretzel sign showed him what really mattered.


"You will see that I'm telling the truth," she'd said the other day. "Just as I am now."


Maybe this was part of it too. Maybe...


"Yeah," he heard himself say, sliding the paper across the counter. "These numbers."


The machine whirred, printing his ticket. Such a small piece of paper to carry so much weight.


"Good luck!" the cashier called as Andrew gathered his purchases. "Hope those numbers change your life!"


Andrew paused at the door, looking at the lottery ticket now tucked into his wallet where Anna's paper had been. "They already have," he murmured, stepping out into the rain.


He pulled out his phone, pulling up the ride-share app. His fingers hovered over Natalie's address for just a moment before tapping it in. Whatever consequences came from skipping this internship, whatever Anna's warnings really meant, one thing was certain.


He was done missing the signs.


The ride to Natalie's apartment felt both endless and too quick, his heart picking up speed with every mile. Rain still pounded against the car windows, but it felt different now - less ominous, more like nature's approval of his choice.


"You can let me out here," he told the driver, spotting the covered entrance to Natalie's building. Lightning illuminated the courtyard as he stepped out, champagne and flowers clutched close, his carry-on getting soaked as he navigated the puddles.


In the elevator, he caught his reflection in the mirrored walls - slightly disheveled from the rain, tie loosened, but smiling.


His hand trembled slightly as he knocked on her door. What if she wasn't home? What if she'd gone to class? What if-


The door opened, and there she was. Hair messy, wearing one of his old hoodies she'd stolen months ago, looking a little pale but beautiful. Her eyes widened in shock.


"Andrew?" She blinked, as if making sure he was real. "What are you doing here? I thought you were on your way to Austin."


"I was." He shifted the flowers and champagne in his arms. "But then a pretzel showed me what really mattered."


"A... pretzel?" Her confusion was adorable.


"I choose you," he said softly, watching her eyes fill with tears. "I choose us. Given a million opportunities, a million dream jobs, a million perfect futures - I'll always choose you."


"But the internship..." she whispered, one hand unconsciously moving to her stomach - a gesture he still didn't quite register. "Andrew, this was your dream."


He shook his head, stepping closer. "No. This is my dream. You're my dream. The rest is just... details."


A tear slipped down her cheek as she reached for him. "You're crazy, you know that?"


"Crazy about you." He grinned, then held up the slightly rain-damaged flowers. "Now, I believe we have a first date to get to. That is, if you'll still have dinner with a guy who follows pretzel signs and shows up at your door soaking wet?"


Natalie laughed through her tears, pulling him inside. "Tell me about this pretzel that apparently changed everything."


"Over dinner," he promised, setting down his things and pulling her close. "I have a feeling this is going to be a night we remember forever."


He had no idea just how right he was.


The Little Venice was everything Andrew had imagined - string lights twinkling in the garden despite the rain, real tablecloths like he'd promised, and their corner table feeling like it existed in a world all their own. Natalie sat across from him, radiant in the dress she'd texted about days ago, though he noticed she'd barely touched her wine.


"So let me get this straight," she said, leaning forward with amusement dancing in her eyes. "You gave up your dream internship because a broken sign at the airport spelled out our initials?"


"When you say it like that, it sounds crazy." He reached across the table, taking her hand. "But it wasn't just the sign. It was everything. The storms, the delays, this feeling I couldn't shake that I was about to miss something important." His thumb traced circles on her palm. "That I was about to miss you."


Natalie's free hand drifted to her purse, where he couldn't see the pregnancy test tucked safely inside. "Actually, Andrew, there's something I need to tell you-"


The restaurant's background music suddenly cut out, replaced by the urgent tone of a news alert. The TV above the bar, usually playing muted sports games, now showed a serious-faced anchor. The volume increased as other diners turned to watch.


"We interrupt this program with breaking news. Flight 887 en route to Austin, Texas, crashed shortly after takeoff amid severe weather conditions. Emergency crews are on-site, but officials have not yet released information regarding survivors. Our thoughts are with all those affected by this tragic event."


The restaurant fell silent. Andrew's hand tightened around Natalie's as the reality of what he was hearing sank in.


"That… That was my flight," he whispered, his voice barely audible. The flight he should have been on. The flight he'd chosen to skip because of a broken pretzel sign and Anna's warnings and the need to be here, with Natalie, right now.


"Andrew..." Natalie's voice cracked, tears spilling down her cheeks. Her hand pressed against her stomach with new urgency, the weight of what could have been - what they could have lost - hitting her full force. "You could have..."

"But I'm here," he said firmly, reaching across to wipe her tears. "I chose to be here. With you."
