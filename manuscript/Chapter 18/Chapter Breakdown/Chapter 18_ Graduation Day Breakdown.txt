SCENE 1: THE CEREMONY
Setting: Campus Quad, Spring Morning
- Graduates gathering
- Andrew and Natalie in robes
- Natalie now very pregnant
- Professor Mendez giving keynote speech
- Quick glimpses of their college memories:
 * Their bench in view
 * Brewed Awakening in distance
 * Places that shaped their story


SCENE 2: ANNA'S FINAL APPEARANCE
Setting: After Ceremony, Quiet Corner of Campus
- Anna approaching Andrew alone
- Different energy about her:
 * Pride instead of urgency
 * Peace instead of warning
 * Almost maternal in her joy
- Their conversation:
 * "I knew you'd make the right choice"
 * Her knowing about the donation
 * Andrew surprised she knows
 * "The lottery money will save countless lives"
 * "Your mother would be proud"
- The unexpected hug from her
- Her whispered "We'll meet again soon"
- Her final look at him before disappearing:
 * Glancing at where Natalie stands in distance
 * A knowing smile
 * Something familiar in her eyes


SCENE 3: THE TRANSITION
- Andrew rejoining Natalie
- Her asking who he was talking to
- Him turning to point, but Anna gone
- The moment suspended between past and future
- His reflection on all the choices that led here
- Final scene: them walking away from campus
- Final line suggesting future revelation: "Four years of mysteries, and I still don't know who she was. But somehow, I think I'm going to find out."
