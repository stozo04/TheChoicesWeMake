Chapter 18: Graduation Day


The morning dew caught the early sunlight, making the rows of white chairs shimmer across the quad. Andrew adjusted Natalie's cap for the third time, his hands lingering on her shoulders.


"It's fine," she laughed, swatting his hands away. "Stop fussing."


"I just want everything perfect." His eyes drifted to where their families sat together in the front row. His grandfather Jim, in his best suit (the one he'd worn to Jill's funeral just months ago), was already dabbing at his eyes with a handkerchief. Natalie's parents flanked him like bookends, her mother's hand resting supportively on his arm, her father leaning in to share some joke that made Jim's shoulders shake with laughter. Her younger sister Emma darted between rows, using programs to save seats for late-arriving aunts and uncles.


They'd left an empty chair beside Jim. For mom, Andrew thought, his throat tightening.


As if reading his mind, Natalie squeezed his hand. Her graduation gown flowing over her six-month bump, the same bump his mother had been so excited about. "She's here," Natalie whispered. "In all the ways that matter."


From where they stood waiting with other graduates, Andrew could see their whole story laid out across campus. The bench with their carved initials catching morning light. Brewed Awakening's windows reflecting gold. The paths they'd walked, the choices they'd made, the mysteries that had guided them here.


"Did you ever think," he asked softly, "that rainy day..that we'd end up here?"


"It turned out better than I could imagine." Natalie turned to face him.


His grin was interrupted by the announcement for graduates to take their places. As they moved into line, he caught his grandfather wiping fresh tears, Natalie's mom now holding the handkerchief for him while her father patted his back. The empty chair beside them didn't feel so empty anymore.


"Hey," Natalie whispered as music began to play. "We made it."


Andrew squeezed her hand, thinking of all the turns that had brought them here - some chosen, some guided, all leading to this moment. "Yeah," he smiled. "We did."


After the ceremony, while families swarmed for photos and hugs, Andrew felt pulled toward their bench. He couldn't explain it, but something about today - graduating, starting their next chapter, Natalie's growing bump, his mother's empty chair - made him need this moment alone with the place where everything began.


The carved "A&N" felt deeper somehow, weathered by seasons but permanent, like their story. How many moments had this bench witnessed? His terrible attempts at flirting in sophomore year, their first real conversation about dreams and fears, the day he finally admitted his feelings. Then later, harder moments - Anna's warnings, Natalie's tears when she saw him with Anna at the café, his decision about the lottery ticket. Through it all, these simple letters had watched, marked their journey.


His fingers traced the grooves, remembering his mother's joy when he'd sheepishly admitted to carving their initials ("So old school, honey. I love it."). Would their daughter someday sit here, tracing these same letters, asking about their story?


"Of all the possibilities... all the paths that could have been... you chose the most beautiful one."


He turned to find Anna standing there, but something was different. Gone was her usual urgency, her cryptic warnings. Instead, she looked almost... surprised. Wondering. Her emerald eyes shone with something he'd never seen before - pure awe.


"The lottery," she continued, her voice soft with amazement. "What you did with it... I never saw that possibility."


Andrew straightened. "You mean you knew other ways it could have gone?"


"So many paths, so many choices." She shook her head, still looking at him with that mix of pride and wonder. "The money could have destroyed everything - your relationship with Natalie, your grandfather's trust, your own soul. I've seen greed poison so much good. But you..." Her voice caught. "You turned it into hope. Into legacy. Into love."


"I just did what Mom would have wanted," he said quietly.


"No." Anna stepped closer, her eyes intense. "You did more than that. You did what was right, even when it was hard. Even when every logical reason said to keep it." She glanced across the quad where Natalie stood with their families, her hand resting on her bump as she laughed at something Emma said. "You protected more than you know."


Before Andrew could respond, Anna did something she'd never done before - she hugged him. The embrace felt oddly familiar, like a memory he couldn't quite place.


"We'll meet again soon," she whispered, then pulled back with tears in her eyes and a knowing smile. "Sooner than you think."


"Anna, wait-" But as always, when he turned back, she was gone.


He stood there for a moment, processing her words, the pride in her eyes, that strange sense of familiarity in her hug. Across the quad, Natalie waved him over, their families gathering for photos.


"Everything okay?" Natalie asked as he rejoined their families, noticing his thoughtful expression.


"Yeah, I just..." He turned back toward the bench, but Anna was gone - like always. Just empty space where she'd stood moments before. "I was talking to..." He trailed off, realizing how impossible it all sounded.


Natalie followed his gaze, understanding crossing her features. "Her again?" she asked softly, so only he could hear. "The mysterious Anna?"


He nodded, watching their families laughing together - his grandfather now showing Emma old photos he'd insisted on bringing, Natalie's parents setting up for one last picture. Past and future, loss and hope, all swirling together on this patch of campus that had shaped their lives.


"You know," Natalie said, her hand finding his while the other rested on their growing daughter, "we should bring her here someday. Show her where it all started."


"The bench?" Andrew smiled, thinking of those carved letters that had witnessed so much.


"All of it. Where you pretended to be bad at calculus." She bumped his shoulder playfully. "Where we fell in love. Where mysterious strangers gave you lottery numbers and warnings about flights."


He pulled her closer, breathing in this moment. "What do we tell her about Anna?"


"The truth," Natalie said simply. "That sometimes life sends us guides when we need them most. That sometimes the biggest mysteries lead us to the most beautiful answers."


As their families called them over for one last photo, Andrew took a final look at their bench. Four years of impossible moments, of choices that changed everything, of a mysterious girl with emerald eyes who seemed to know exactly what they needed, even when they didn't.


He still didn't know who Anna really was. But watching Natalie walk ahead of him, her graduation gown flowing over their growing daughter, he had a feeling they were going to find out. Some mysteries, after all, were just beginnings in disguise.
