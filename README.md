## File Organization

Each chapter is organized across multiple files to maintain a clear structure:

| Chapter | Main Text | Breakdown | Scene |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 01 | `chapters/01_[chapter_name].txt` | `chapter_breakdowns/01_[chapter_name]_breakdown.txt`  `chapter_breakdowns/01_[chapter_name]_breakdown.json`| `chapter_scenes/01_[chapter_name]_scene.txt` |
| 02 | `chapters/02_[chapter_name].txt` | `chapter_breakdowns/02_[chapter_name]_breakdown.txt`  `chapter_breakdowns/02_[chapter_name]_breakdown.json`| `chapter_scenes/02_[chapter_name]_scene.txt` |

**Note about NEW_ files:** Files in chapter_breakdowns/ prefixed with NEW_ are revised or experimental outlines for that chapter, created after the original breakdown. For example, NEW_12_letters_unsent.txt is a newer draft outline exploring Natalie's pregnancy reveal, which may differ from the original Chapter 12 breakdown.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project leverages AI (ChatGPT) for developmental feedback. The `AI_feedback/` directory contains the prompts, analyses, and reports generated during deep research of the manuscript. Compiled reports of this feedback are in the `pdfs/` directory. These resources helped identify improvements and ensure consistency in the narrative.
