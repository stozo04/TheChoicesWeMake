Timeline Analysis – Consistencies & Contradictions
The timeline of The Choices We Make is generally coherent and follows the characters’ four-year journey through college into young adulthood. Key life events – friendship, love, heartbreak, supernatural guidance, tragedy, and fulfillment – unfold in a logical sequence. However, there are a few notable inconsistencies and potential flaws in the time progression and character actions. Below is an analysis of these issues, with insights into how they affect the story and how they might be addressed:
1. Academic Calendar vs. Pregnancy Timeline: One apparent timeline hiccup involves Natalie’s pregnancy in relation to graduation. At the graduation ceremony (which we naturally assume is in May of senior year), Natalie is described as “six-months” pregnant, her gown draping over a noticeable bump​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. This detail suggests she conceived roughly six months prior – around November of the previous year. Normally, a six-month pregnant woman would have about three months remaining before birth (putting the due date in late summer). Yet, a few pages later in Chapter 19, the narration states “February had melted into March” and that their daughter is “due in just over a month.”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Early March to birth in April implies Natalie is about eight months pregnant at that point. The contradiction is that if Natalie was only six months along at graduation (presumably May or perhaps February if we consider an off-schedule ceremony), she wouldn’t reach eight months until two months later. In other words, the timing of graduation relative to the pregnancy is confusing. It reads as if graduation happened in winter (February) rather than the typical spring, which is not clearly explained. This inconsistency likely isn’t intentional; it’s more a slight oversight in aligning the academic timeline with the pregnancy timeline. A constructive fix could be to clarify that the college held an early graduation ceremony or that Natalie was actually further along at commencement. For instance, if the story specified that they graduated in February (an unusual but not impossible scenario) or had finished coursework early due to their circumstances, the baby’s April due date would line up. Alternatively, the author could adjust Natalie’s described pregnancy stage at graduation to “around seven/eight months” to better match the March timeline. As it stands, readers may momentarily get distracted trying to do the pregnancy math. Fortunately, this is a minor logical issue that doesn’t detract heavily from the emotional impact – most readers will understand the baby is imminent after graduation, even if the months don’t perfectly add up.
2. Compressed Sequence of Major Events: The novel’s pacing in the final year of college is extremely eventful – arguably to a near-unrealistic degree. Within what seems like a few months of senior year, Andrew and Natalie go from finally dating, to an unplanned pregnancy, to a near-fatal plane crash incident, to winning the lottery, to losing a parent, to graduation, marriage, and preparing for a baby. That is a lot of life-changing events squeezed into a short timeframe. While each crisis and triumph is compelling, some readers might feel their heads spin at how quickly one thing follows another. From a realism standpoint, it’s rare for so many high-stakes situations to resolve in such swift succession. For example, Andrew literally has back-to-back miracles: surviving a plane crash he never boarded and then hitting the jackpot days or weeks later. The probability of either is low, let alone both. The story justifies this through its destiny/fate theme – implying these outcomes were orchestrated by Anna or by fate’s design. Still, one could argue this stacks coincidences in a way that strains believability. Character-wise, it also raises questions: How are Andrew and Natalie coping with so much change emotionally? The narrative does show them reacting (Andrew has moments of overwhelm, Natalie breaks down over the pregnancy news, etc.), but there’s little downtime for them to process one event before the next hits. Constructively, the author might have spaced out some events or hinted at them earlier to smooth the pacing. For instance, Jill’s illness was seeded early on, which is good foreshadowing for her passing. But the lottery plot arrives quite late; introducing the idea of lottery numbers a bit earlier (it does come up around mid-story, but very briefly) or even allowing a slight time jump could give breathing room. As a positive, the rapid succession of events does keep the story engaging and page-turning, and each plot turn is logically triggered by the previous (e.g. pregnancy leads to conflict over internship; skipping internship leads to survival; survival and impending fatherhood lead to using the lottery numbers; the lottery win ties into helping his dying mother, etc.). So while fast-paced, the chain reaction has internal logic. It’s a deliberate narrative choice to underscore the theme that when destiny is at work, “when it rains, it pours” – both blessings and challenges. Readers willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of drama will enjoy the emotional rollercoaster, but more critical readers might view the density of climactic moments as a believability issue. In summary, the timeline could feel rushed, but it’s coherent in cause-and-effect; spacing events over a slightly longer period (maybe having some occur earlier in their college years) might have felt more realistic.
3. Character Reactions and Decisions Over Time: For the most part, the characters’ actions align with their established motivations, but there are a few spots where timing affects believability:
* Natalie’s Delay in Telling Andrew About the Pregnancy: Natalie waits to tell Andrew that she’s pregnant, partly because she’s in shock and partly because she doesn’t want to derail his focus on the impending internship. This hesitation is in character for someone responsible and caring – she puts his dream ahead of her fear. However, there’s a brief period where Andrew is worrying about her mysterious “illness” and even plans to leave town while she’s unwell. One might question if Natalie would really let him depart without telling him the truth. She nearly does – he was at the airport not knowing he’s about to be a father. From a logical standpoint, this is risky; if the plane incident hadn’t intervened, Andrew would have flown out clueless. However, the text implies Natalie intended to tell him that day (perhaps she was on her way to do so or would have before he boarded). The extreme circumstances (Andrew nearly leaving, then the crash) forced the reveal anyway. This slight tension in her behavior isn’t so much a flaw as it is a reflection of her anxiety. It’s actually realistic that a young woman in her situation might delay a difficult conversation, hoping for “one normal day” with her boyfriend before everything changes​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. And narratively, her delay heightens the drama. No contradiction here per se, but it’s a moment where a character’s timing (or lack thereof) could frustrate readers – the classic “if only they talked sooner!” scenario. The novel resolves it sensibly: Natalie wasn’t going to hide it much longer, and Andrew doesn’t hold the delay against her once he knows.

* Andrew’s Internship and Academic Responsibilities: Another time-related question is how Andrew manages to complete his degree requirements given the chaos. He skips out on the internship/training in Austin (likely losing that opportunity), and later he spends time dealing with family emergencies. Yet by Chapter 18, he still graduates on schedule and even tops his class in some respects. We do see Professor Mendez offering mentorship and presumably academic leniency (he shows up at the wedding as a sign of support). It’s believable that Andrew made up any missed work or was given extensions due to his circumstances – universities often accommodate students facing medical or personal crises. The novel doesn’t explicitly detail Andrew finishing his big project or how he caught up after the missed internship, but since we see him graduate, we infer it worked out. This is a minor hand-wave in the timeline: some readers might wonder, “Wait, didn’t he tank his internship? How’s he graduating so calmly?” A line or two indicating he completed an alternate assignment or that the internship wasn’t mandatory for his degree would clear it up. As it stands, it’s not a glaring plot hole – it’s reasonable to assume he refocused on school once the dust settled. The timeline from plane incident (likely mid-semester) to graduation is a couple of months; enough time to finish coursework if one is diligent. Andrew’s determination and help from faculty likely filled the gap.

* Natalie’s Senior Year and Health: Similarly, Natalie not only finishes school while pregnant but apparently does so with flying colors (she walks at graduation on time). Being pregnant in college is challenging but certainly possible, especially with supportive family and friends. The story shows Natalie dealing with morning sickness early on​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
, but after that, we don’t hear of major pregnancy complications interfering with classes. One could argue this is a bit idealized – many women might need to take a lighter course load or miss some classes in later stages, but Natalie seems to push through. Given her characterization as organized and resilient, it’s not inconsistent that she handles it. She even stands at graduation eight months along, which is tough but doable. This is more a realism note than a timeline flaw. Perhaps in real life she might have considered finishing a semester early or walking at a later ceremony, but narratively, having them graduate together is more satisfying. It’s a testament to Natalie’s strength that she literally carries a child while closing out her college career. The timeline supports this since she got pregnant toward the end of the fall – by late spring she was still mobile enough for ceremonies. All in all, her academic timeline remains intact, if a bit supermom-ish (finishing finals while in third trimester is no small feat!).

4. The Anna Paradox – Time Travel and Identity: The most intriguing timeline complexity is the time-bending nature of Anna’s character. By the end, it’s heavily implied (and confirmed in the epilogue) that the mysterious Anna who guided Andrew and Natalie is actually their future daughter, Dr. Anna Nolan, somehow acting in the past. This creates a bootstrap paradox: Anna exists because Andrew and Natalie made the choices that led to her birth, but those choices were influenced by Anna herself. In terms of logical consistency, this is a classic time-travel conundrum – one that the novel intentionally toys with as a mystery. Some analytical readers might raise questions like: How did adult Anna travel back? At what points in time did she intervene (and was she the same age each time)? Did changing events (like preventing Andrew’s death and using the lottery differently) alter Anna’s own future, or was it always a closed loop? The story doesn’t explicitly answer the mechanics, which may be seen as a flaw or just an open-ended fantasy element, depending on the reader’s taste. What we do know is Anna had knowledge far beyond a normal person: she knew lottery numbers, knew about a plane crash in advance, and even knew personal details of Andrew’s life. This strongly indicates a supernatural or futuristic origin. The epilogue conversation suggests that the daughter Anna herself has awareness or memories of those interventions​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. If she literally remembers guiding her parents (perhaps via time travel or some inherited memory), it implies that in her timeline, she reached adulthood and then found a way to loop back to ensure all went as it should. This is a time progression loop that, strictly speaking, defies linear logic – yet it’s a common trope in science fiction and fantasy. The novel leans into a “fate” explanation: it doesn’t bother with a sci-fi device (no time machine or overt magic is described) and instead frames Anna’s presence as almost angelic. Because of this approach, many readers will accept the paradox as part of the story’s magic – essentially, “Anna was meant to be, so she was there guiding them all along.” However, if one demands logical explanation, this area is the fuzziest. It’s left to interpretation whether Anna is literally time-traveling or if she’s a metaphysical guide (like a guardian angel taking the form of their future child). The constructive insight here is that a bit more clarification could help. A single line in the epilogue where older Anna explains, for instance, “I don’t know how, but I’ve dreamed of moments from before I was born, and I was there for you,” could frame it as a spiritual connection rather than physical time travel. Conversely, if the author wanted a sci-fi angle, they could hint that Anna discovered something (a note, a phenomenon at the hospital, etc.) that enabled her to go back. Without such lines, some readers might finish the book with questions: Did Anna actively change the past or was everything predestined? and Does this violate causality? Since the story’s heart is more about love and choices than the technicalities of time travel, the ambiguity doesn’t ruin the enjoyment – but it does require the reader to suspend disbelief and embrace a paradox. In terms of timeline consistency, one could jokingly ask: If Anna “never saw the possibility” of Andrew donating the lottery money​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
, then doesn’t that mean her own future knowledge was incomplete or changed? It appears the future was not fixed until Andrew made that final virtuous choice, surprising even Anna. This might imply that Anna came from a future where perhaps a different outcome happened (maybe in her original timeline, Andrew claimed the money and it caused troubles – a scenario she was trying to prevent). If so, the book suggests one can alter the timeline for the better, which Anna succeeded in doing by guiding them. All told, the Anna paradox is a fascinating but head-spinning element. Rather than a mistake, it seems to be an intentional mystery – the “biggest mystery leading to the most beautiful answer,” as Natalie puts it​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Still, it’s an area where logical minds will poke holes (time travel always has holes!). The constructive takeaway is that the novel could offer a touch more exposition in the epilogue for closure. It does give closure emotionally – Andrew realizes the truth and presumably they all accept it – but a clearer cause for how Anna did what she did would satisfy readers who like their loops neatly closed. On the flip side, leaving it open-ended invites fun discussion and doesn’t bog down the narrative with technical details. It fits the whimsical, fate-driven tone that some things in life (and time) are beyond complete understanding.
5. Minor Continuity Details: Aside from the larger points above, the timeline maintains good continuity for character arcs. A couple of small things to note:
   * Natalie’s ex-boyfriend Chris disappears after the breakup, which is logical (he’s out of her life), but one might wonder if he ever learned she was pregnant so soon after their split. The story doesn’t address this, and it likely doesn’t matter to the main plot. It’s just a realistic curiosity; however, since Natalie and Chris were together four years, one might expect at least a mention of him reacting or any gossip. The novel stays firmly focused on Andrew and Natalie’s world, so Chris remains a dropped thread (not truly a flaw, as his purpose in the story was fulfilled).
   * Andrew’s carved initials on the bench (“A&N”) present a sweet continuity of their relationship. The text explicitly mentions him doing it and later them revisiting it​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. This was consistent – first referenced in Chapter 18 and again in the epilogue when they talk about showing their daughter the bench. No issues there; it’s a nice through-line that the bench witnessed all key moments.
   * Support Network: The timeline consistently shows Sarah (Natalie’s best friend) and Andrew’s grandfather Jim as steady presences. They appear at logically appropriate times – e.g., Sarah is there for Natalie during the pregnancy test​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup, Jim is around during the hospital and wedding scenes. The author didn’t forget these side characters, which helps the realism. Their involvement at each stage makes the progression feel more natural and less like Andrew and Natalie are in a bubble.
   * Emotional Continuity: A strength in the timeline is that each major event leaves a trace on the characters in subsequent chapters. For example, after the plane incident, Andrew remains visibly shaken and extra protective of Natalie (“when I think about that flight…” he says while holding her close)​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. After Jill’s death, Andrew’s grief is evident at graduation (the empty chair, his throat tightening)​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup and it fuels his resolve to do good with the lottery money. These consistent emotional callbacks ground the fantastical plot points in human experience, enhancing logical flow. Nothing is simply forgotten once it’s resolved; the characters carry their past with them, as people do.
In conclusion, The Choices We Make manages an ambitious timeline that interweaves romance, personal growth, and supernatural mystery over four years and beyond. For the most part, it succeeds – the sequence of events follows a cause-and-effect logic driven by the characters’ choices (hitting the theme on the nose). The few timeline inconsistencies (like the exact months of the pregnancy vs. graduation) are relatively minor and do not confuse the overall story arc. They could be easily addressed with small clarifications but don’t significantly undermine the narrative. The time-travel paradox surrounding Anna is arguably a feature rather than a bug, but it does introduce some logical gray areas. Readers willing to accept a bit of magical realism will find the ending elegant and satisfying, whereas more analytical readers might crave an explanation of how Anna pulled it off. From a constructive standpoint, tightening those timeline details and offering a hint more explanation of Anna’s mechanism would polish the story’s logic. Nevertheless, the heart of the novel – its emotional truth and the message about selfless choices – shines through any timeline quibbles. The slight chronological flaws do not detract from the characters’ development; in fact, they underline how extraordinary the journey has been. Ultimately, the timeline holds together well enough to deliver a moving, “full circle” tale, and the few cracks in its logic can inspire thoughtful interpretation rather than outright confusion.
