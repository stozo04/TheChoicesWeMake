The Choices We Make – Major Events Timeline
1. Andrew and Natalie’s Friendship Begins (Freshman Year): Andrew Nolan and Natalie Alexander start college as best friends. Andrew harbors a secret love for Natalie, who is in a long-term relationship with her high school sweetheart, Chris. In Chapter 1, at a cozy campus coffee shop, Andrew struggles with whether to confess his feelings. He decides against it, staying a supportive friend while Natalie chats about her upcoming anniversary with Chris​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. This establishes their close bond and Andrew’s internal conflict from the outset.
2. A Mysterious Stranger Appears – “Anna” (Early Sophomore Year): During an autumn encounter on a campus bench, Andrew meets an enigmatic young woman with piercing green eyes who introduces herself as Anna. She delivers a cryptic message about choices and destiny, hinting that Andrew will face a pivotal decision​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. Anna encourages him to “make the right choice,” instilling both curiosity and confusion in Andrew. He senses her advice relates to his unspoken love for Natalie​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. This surreal meeting plants the seed that supernatural guidance may be at play in his life. Anna disappears as mysteriously as she arrived, leaving Andrew bewildered about who she is and how she knows so much about him​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup.
3. Natalie’s Four-Year Relationship Ends (Mid College – Junior Year): Natalie’s romance with Chris deteriorates. In Chapter 4, during what should be a celebratory four-year anniversary dinner, Natalie feels a growing emotional distance​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. The night turns into a breakup when Chris admits his heart isn’t in the relationship anymore. “Four years, Natalie. Four years we’ve been together, and this is how it ends?” he says bitterly​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Heartbroken, Natalie realizes she’s been holding onto a relationship that no longer works. This breakup is a turning point for her character, leaving her vulnerable and more reliant on Andrew’s friendship for support.
4. Confessions and Comfort (Junior Year): In the aftermath of Natalie’s breakup, Andrew steps up to comfort her. Chapter 5 finds Natalie distraught, and she confides in Andrew about her fears of the future after losing someone she invested four years in. Andrew provides a shoulder to cry on and almost confesses his own feelings, but he hesitates, fearing the timing is wrong so soon after her breakup. This moment deepens their bond: Natalie begins to see how steadfast Andrew’s care for her is, and Andrew realizes how much it hurts him to see her in pain. Their friendship shifts into a more intimate emotional territory, setting the stage for romance. Andrew’s personal life also grows more complicated around this time – his mother, Jill, has been battling illness (cancer), and he’s balancing concern for his family with academic responsibilities. The “Deadlines” (Chapter 6) chapter highlights Andrew pouring himself into a major project and internship application while worrying about his mom’s health and his unresolved feelings for Natalie.
5. Anna’s Continued Warnings (Late Junior to Early Senior Year): Throughout this period, Anna appears periodically to Andrew, always when he’s alone and at a crossroads. In Chapter 6, as Andrew stresses over a looming project deadline in the library, he spots Anna sketching in a corner. Surprised that she’s reappeared in his life, he confronts her. Anna offers more ambiguous guidance, implying she “knows things” about his life that he doesn’t​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. Frustration boils over – Andrew demands straightforward answers, even snapping that he has “real problems” (his mother’s illness and academic pressure) and no time for her riddles​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Anna pleads with him to “pay attention” to the signs around him and trust his heart​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. These supernatural interventions both intrigue and irritate Andrew. He can’t deny that Anna’s advice often foreshadows real dilemmas (such as urging him to prioritize what truly matters), yet her presence threatens his sense of control. Notably, Anna’s cryptic comment “Sometimes the hardest choices are the ones that lead us to our true destiny” lingers in his mind​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup, guiding his decisions even when he tries to ignore her.
6. The Art Walk and Birthday Promise (Senior Year, Fall): After surviving the intense project deadline, Andrew invites Natalie to an art walk festival in town (Chapter 7). It’s a lighthearted evening that allows them to relax together and showcases their deepening connection. Among creative street exhibits and twinkling lights, Andrew and Natalie talk about their dreams and fears more openly than ever before. By now, Natalie is single and starting to view Andrew in a new light. In Chapter 8 (“The Birthday Promise”), one of them celebrates a 21st birthday (the story hints it’s Andrew’s birthday). During a small gathering, Natalie gives Andrew a heartfelt gift and a promise: she vows to always be by his side in the years ahead. Andrew, in turn, privately promises himself that he’ll tell Natalie how he truly feels soon. This phase marks a hopeful calm before the storm – their friendship has evolved into something very close to love, yet they haven’t explicitly admitted it. The stage is set for a romantic breakthrough.
7. Jeopardy at the Café – Natalie Learns the Truth (Senior Year, Winter): The brewing romance nearly derails due to a misunderstanding in Chapter 10. Natalie accidentally sees Andrew meeting with Anna at a campus café. From Natalie’s perspective, it looks like Andrew has been secretly talking to an attractive girl behind her back. Hurt and insecure, Natalie assumes Andrew might have feelings for this “mysterious stranger” and pulls away in heartbreak. In Chapter 11 (“Bridges Burn and Built”), Andrew realizes Natalie is distancing herself and finally learns why. This leads to a dramatic confrontation where he must come clean. Andrew finds Natalie in tears and professes his love to her outright: “Natalie, I love you… I have loved you from the day I met you. Please believe me. I would never do anything to hurt you”​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. He explains that Anna is not a romantic interest but an odd friend who gives him advice (as unbelievable as that sounds). Natalie, who has secretly loved Andrew too, breaks down and admits she was afraid of losing him. She reciprocates his feelings, whispering “I love you too”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. This heartfelt exchange rebuilds the “burned bridge” between them. The two officially become a couple, sealing what had been years in the making. This is a major character development moment: Andrew overcomes his fear and Natalie overcomes her doubt, allowing their love story to truly begin.
8. New Love and an Unexpected Pregnancy (Senior Year, Winter): Now happier than ever, Andrew and Natalie share a brief period of bliss as a new couple. They spend more time together romantically, finally going on dates rather than just friendly hangouts. In an intense moment of passion (implied to occur shortly after their reconciliation), they conceive a child – though of course neither realizes it at the time. A few weeks pass, and Natalie starts feeling off. Chapter 12 (“Natalie’s Pregnancy Reveal”) depicts her experiencing nausea during class and nearly fainting. Her best friend Sarah rushes her to the bathroom. There, Natalie admits her period is late, and the two take a pregnancy test. In a tense scene, Natalie waits as the timer counts down. When she finally looks, she’s shocked to see two pink lines indicating a positive result​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Natalie is pregnant with Andrew’s baby. This revelation is emotionally charged: Natalie is overwhelmed by the news – this joyous but life-altering development comes just as their relationship started. She tearfully confides to Sarah her worries: “Everything else will change… we just finally got everything right, and now—”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. At this point, Natalie hasn’t told Andrew yet. She’s fearful about how he’ll react, especially with so many other pressures (school, his sick mom) in play. This event is a crucial plot point that will test both characters’ growth and commitment.
9. Dreams vs. Responsibility – The Internship Dilemma (Senior Year, Spring): Around the same time, Andrew achieves a personal milestone: he’s offered a dream internship/job opportunity with a prestigious tech company in Austin, Texas. This is the culmination of his hard work (as seen in Chapter 6’s “Deadlines”). However, the timing couldn’t be worse. The internship requires him to fly out at the end of the week for an orientation/training, which coincides with Natalie’s early pregnancy struggles and his mother’s worsening condition. In Chapter 13 (“Dreams and Sacrifices”), Andrew faces a wrenching choice: pursue his career dream or stay to support Natalie. Natalie, still hiding her pregnancy, urges him to follow his dream, telling him she’s just down with a “stomach bug.” Andrew is torn. Anna appears once more with urgent advice, emphasizing that “the choices you make now will change everything”​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. Andrew is frustrated by her cryptic warnings and nearly dismisses her—yet her concern for him and Natalie is clear. By Friday morning in Chapter 14 (“The Flight That Never Was”), Andrew arrives at the airport still conflicted. A severe storm delays Flight 887 to Austin that he’s booked on​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. As he waits, guilt gnaws at him; his heart is back home with Natalie, who seemed sicker (and more anxious) than just a normal flu. Remembering Anna’s urging to “pay attention to the signs,” Andrew notices a small sign – literally: the neon pretzel logo at an airport snack stand flickers and breaks. It’s a trivial thing, but in that moment Andrew takes it as a last straw signal that he should not board the plane. Acting on instinct and Anna’s warnings, he decides to skip the flight entirely and rushes back to campus to be with Natalie. This fateful decision saves his life. Hours later, news breaks that Flight 887 crashed shortly after takeoff amid the storm, with no known survivors​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Andrew reels with shock and relief: “That…that was my flight,” he whispers, realizing he narrowly escaped death​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. This is one of the novel’s most dramatic turning points. It validates Anna’s guidance in Andrew’s eyes and reinforces the theme that listening to his heart (choosing loved ones over career at that moment) was literally lifesaving.
10. Truths Revealed and a Stronger Bond (Senior Year, Spring): After the near-disaster, Andrew rushes to Natalie, and she finally tells him the truth about her “bug.” In an emotional reunion scene (end of Chapter 14 into Chapter 15), Natalie likely reveals she’s pregnant with his child, explaining her recent strange behavior. Andrew is overwhelmed – in one day he avoided a fatal tragedy and learned he’s going to be a father. He responds with both relief and devotion, hugging Natalie and declaring, “I love you… Both of you”​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. The phrase “both of you” shows Andrew immediately accepts and loves the baby as part of their future. They acknowledge how close he came to leaving them behind; Andrew shudders at “when I think about that flight… what I almost…” lost​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. This heart-to-heart cements their unity. Additionally, Andrew comes clean about Anna’s role in recent events. He tells Natalie (and their loyal friend Sarah) about the mysterious woman who gave him warnings – including that he had a bad feeling about the flight. Rather than reacting with disbelief, Natalie trusts Andrew’s account. In fact, by now Natalie herself suspects there’s something extraordinary about Anna; she saw how Andrew’s choices always seemed guided. This open exchange eliminates any secrets between Andrew and Natalie, marking a healthy turning point. From here on, they face challenges as a true team.
11. The Winning Lottery Ticket (Late Spring, Senior Year): As graduation approaches, finances and the future loom large. Andrew is now jobless (he forfeited the internship) and about to become a parent. In Chapter 16 (“The Lottery”), a remarkable opportunity arises from Anna’s earlier intervention. During one of their past encounters, Andrew half-jokingly challenged Anna to provide proof of her knowledge by giving him winning lottery numbers​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. To his surprise, Anna actually did scribble down a sequence of numbers on paper – but Andrew, skeptical and ethical, promised he wouldn’t use them. He tucked the note away and forgot it. Now, months later, that note resurfaces in his wallet​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. With bills mounting and desperation creeping in, Andrew wavers. He ultimately buys a ticket using Anna’s numbers​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. The draw occurs, and the jackpot is a staggering sum (the story mentions ~$350 million)​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. Andrew’s numbers hit, making him the sole winner of a life-changing fortune. A news bulletin reports a “mystery winner yet to claim prize” as Andrew quietly confirms the ticket in his hand​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Initially, this feels like a godsend: he can pay for his mother’s medical care, support his future family, and never worry about money again. Yet, true to the novel’s theme, this windfall comes with weighty choices. Anna’s previous cryptic warning rings in his ears: “Such a small thing to prove my trust, but carrying a heavy price… The consequences…they’re too severe.”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. It seems even good fortune can lead to ruin if handled poorly. Andrew faces a moral test: what will he do with this power?
12. Loss and Legacy – A Selfless Choice (Early Summer, post-finals): Before Andrew can act on the lottery win, his personal life hits a painful milestone in Chapter 17 (“Loss and Legacy”). Jill Nolan, Andrew’s beloved mother, loses her battle with cancer and passes away. This tragedy deeply affects Andrew, coming so soon after everything else. He’s grief-stricken that his mom won’t meet her granddaughter, though he’s grateful she knew a grandchild was on the way. (Indeed, Andrew and Natalie told Jill about the baby in time to bring her joy – Jill “couldn’t stop crying with pride” over the news​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup.) After the funeral, Andrew is confronted by a stack of medical bills and the sight of his grandfather Jim quietly worrying over finances​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Now the enormous lottery ticket in his wallet weighs on him more than ever​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Anna’s caution that the money could come with terrible consequences echoes loudly. Andrew realizes one obvious pitfall: sudden wealth might breed greed or conflict, potentially poisoning his relationships​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Determined not to let that fate unfold, he considers an alternative path. While leafing through a family photo album, Andrew discovers a journal entry from his mom about another cancer patient selling everything to afford treatment​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. This inspires him to imagine a higher purpose for the money. In a moment of maturity and vision, Andrew decides not to claim the jackpot for himself at all. Instead, he formulates a plan to donate the lottery winnings anonymously to fund cancer research and charity. In a heartfelt scene, Andrew writes a letter to accompany the winning ticket, dedicating it in his mother Jill’s memory: “May it help find a cure so no other mother misses meeting their grandchild – Donated by Jill Nolan”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. He effectively gives away the $350 million prize for the greater good. This selfless act honors his mother’s legacy and ensures the money will “turn into hope…into legacy…into love,” rather than causing strife​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. It’s a defining character moment: Andrew chooses integrity and compassion over personal gain, fully embodying the novel’s theme that the choices we make define us. Natalie wholeheartedly supports this decision, knowing it’s what Jill would have wanted and that she and Andrew can build a happy life without a fortune. (Importantly, Andrew’s financial sacrifice is buffered by the fact he and Natalie have strong family support and college degrees – they’re not wealthy, but they’ll manage.)
13. Graduation Day (End of Senior Year): Chapter 18 brings the culmination of Andrew and Natalie’s college journey. Despite all the turbulence, they both complete their degrees on time. Graduation is depicted as a beautiful spring morning on campus, with rows of white chairs on the quad​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. Andrew and Natalie don their caps and gowns, experiencing a mix of triumph and bittersweet emotion. Natalie is visibly six months pregnant at this ceremony, her gown flowing over her baby bump​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. In the front row, their families sit together – Andrew’s Grandpa Jim (dabbing tears of pride) and Natalie’s parents side by side, symbolizing the merging of their support systems​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. A solitary empty chair is left in honor of Jill Nolan, reminding everyone of her absence​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Before the ceremony, Andrew fusses sweetly over Natalie’s cap, wanting everything to be perfect. Natalie laughs and says, “Stop fussing… We made it,” acknowledging how much they’ve overcome​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. As they walk across the stage and receive diplomas, it’s a triumphant moment: “Hey, we made it,” Natalie whispers, and Andrew replies “Yeah, we did.”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. After graduating, amid the swirl of hugs and photos, Andrew feels pulled toward the old campus bench where their story began. He and Natalie wander to that familiar spot, carved with their initials “A&N” (which Andrew had etched there after they became a couple, as a romantic, “old school” gesture​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup). Here, the couple reflects on their journey: all the little moments (“your terrible attempts at flirting in sophomore year”) and big moments (“the day he finally admitted his feelings” and the later trials with Anna’s warnings and the lottery decision) that led them to this point​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. This reflective pause shows how much both characters have grown up over four years of love, loss, and learning.
14. Final Visit from Anna – The Truth Hinted (Graduation Day, continued): As Andrew stands at the bench soaking in memories, Anna appears one last time beside him (her timing, as always, is impeccable). In this encounter, Anna is not issuing a warning but instead congratulating Andrew. She tells him, “Of all the paths that could have been… you chose the most beautiful one,” referring to the way he handled the lottery and his life choices​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. Anna’s emerald eyes shine with pride and even surprise – she admits, “What you did with [the lottery]… I never saw that possibility.”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. This reveals that Anna, who seems to have knowledge of multiple possible futures, did not predict Andrew’s completely selfless act. He has exceeded her expectations. Andrew, astonished, asks if she knew of other ways things could have gone. Anna nods and explains that in many timelines, money and greed could have destroyed everything – his relationship, his family’s trust, even his character​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. “I’ve seen greed poison so much good,” she says, implying she has witnessed darker versions of events. “But you…turned it into hope and legacy.”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup At this, Andrew realizes Anna truly has been watching over the many “choices” and outcomes all along. He thanks her, and with deep emotion, Anna steps forward and hugs Andrew for the first time​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. The hug feels “oddly familiar, like a memory he couldn’t place,” hinting at a familial connection. With tears in her eyes, Anna whispers, “We’ll meet again soon – sooner than you think.”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup Then, as always, she vanishes before Andrew can say more​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. This poignant farewell strongly implies the truth about Anna’s identity. Andrew is left standing there, heart pounding. Natalie comes over and gently asks if he’s okay, having noticed he was “talking to…her again”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Natalie now fully believes in Anna’s existence and significance. Andrew admits Anna was congratulating them and seems at peace. Natalie, resting a hand on her belly, smiles and muses that one day they’ll bring their daughter to this campus and tell her the whole story – “Where it all started… where mysterious strangers gave you lottery numbers and warnings about flights.”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Andrew pulls her close and asks, “What do we tell her about Anna?”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Natalie replies simply that they’ll tell their daughter the truth: sometimes life “sends us guides when we need them most”, and that the biggest mysteries can lead to the most beautiful outcomes​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. This indicates they view Anna as a guardian angel or benevolent guide. As family members call them for a final graduation photo, Andrew glances back and reflects on “four years of impossible moments” with a “mysterious girl with emerald eyes who seemed to know exactly what they needed”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. He still isn’t 100% sure who or what Anna truly is, but he has a strong feeling that answer will reveal itself in time​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. This wraps up the main narrative with hope and anticipation.
15. New Beginnings – A Wedding and a Baby (Post-Graduation, Early the next year): In Chapter 19, the story jumps ahead a short while after graduation. “February had melted into March, graduation gowns traded for wedding clothes,” the narration notes​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. With Natalie due to give birth in just over a month, the couple decides on a quick courthouse wedding rather than a long engagement​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. This decision fits their journey – after everything, they know they’re committed for life, so a simple ceremony feels right. Surrounded by a small group of loved ones, Andrew and Natalie exchange vows. The scene is intimate and joyful: Andrew is fidgety with nerves and excitement, prompting Grandpa Jim to tease that he’s “worse than your mother was on her wedding day”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Natalie, eight months pregnant but radiant in a simple white dress, walks down the hallway with her parents at her side. Even Professor Mendez (Andrew’s mentor) slips in to witness the moment, showing how their support network has grown. The ceremony itself isn’t described in detail, but the essence is that Andrew and Natalie are married, affirming their choice to formally become a family before their daughter’s arrival. Shortly thereafter (likely in April), Natalie gives birth to a healthy baby girl. The novel implies this but doesn’t narrate a birth scene. We learn the baby’s name is Anna – a choice that speaks volumes. By naming their daughter after the mysterious guide who shaped their lives, Andrew and Natalie honor the miracle that brought them together. It also foreshadows the story’s ultimate reveal: the two Annas are one and the same. The new parents finally come to understand (at least in hindsight) that the enigmatic “Anna” who intervened in their lives was in fact a future version or spiritual echo of their own child. This revelation is subtle in the main timeline – they don’t see baby Anna time-travel, but all the hints (the familiar hug, the eyes, the phrase “we’ll meet again soon” spoken right before their daughter’s birth) click into place for the reader here. Andrew and Natalie’s story concludes with hope and gratitude. They have navigated every twist of fate, and now begin a new chapter as a family.
16. Full Circle – Epilogue (25 Years Later): In a touching epilogue (Chapter 20: Full Circle), the novel jumps roughly twenty-five years into the future. Andrew is in his late forties, Natalie in her mid-forties, and they reunite with their daughter Anna Nolan – now an adult – at a very meaningful location. Anna has grown up to become a doctor, inspired by the legacy of the grandmother she never met. In fact, they meet at the Jill Nolan Memorial Hospital, a cutting-edge cancer research hospital funded by that long-ago lottery donation​
file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup
. Dr. Anna Nolan, at 24 years old, is starting her first day as an oncologist there – coming “full circle” to carry on Jill’s dream. Andrew is flooded with memories as he watches his daughter in her white coat, remembering her childhood passion for healing and the promises she made to honor Jill’s memory​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. During a quiet moment in the hospital atrium, adult Anna gently confronts her father. She looks at Jill’s portrait on the wall and asks why he “pretend[s] none of this ever happened”, referring to the extraordinary events in their family history​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. Andrew initially thinks she means her grandmother, but Anna clarifies: “I’m not talking about Grandma… I’m talking about us.”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. In this powerful exchange, Anna’s eyes shine with the same uncanny emerald glint and intense, knowing look that Andrew recalls from a “hauntingly familiar figure from distant memories”​file-rcjcgkrukuvpdanrg9ecup. It finally dawns on him that the mysterious woman who guided him and Natalie through their youth was his own daughter, Anna, somehow visiting from the future. The truth is laid bare: all those years ago, Anna literally kept her parents’ lives on track so that she could exist and ensure a better future. This realization brings Andrew to tears, and he embraces his daughter with awe. The novel closes on this emotional full-circle revelation, tying together the time-bending mystery with the family’s legacy of love and choices. It’s a beautifully imaginative conclusion that redefines everything that came before.
