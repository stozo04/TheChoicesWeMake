Andrew Nolan had always believed in beginnings. New calendars, new notebooks, new chances—each one a quiet promise that this time he would be braver than the last. Move-in day at Lakefield University should have felt like the sweetest beginning of all: senior year, the crest of everything he and Natalie Reyes had been building toward since the first time they sat beneath the big-limbed oak just off the quad.

But as the August dawn unraveled across the sky in bruises of lavender and rose, he felt a different tug in his chest, something closer to urgency. If he didn’t tell her—today, not tomorrow, not “when the moment felt right”—he might never find the courage. Life, he was learning, could sprint ahead without waiting for the uncertain.

A breeze rattled the leaves overhead, turning their edges into a thousand tiny chimes. They were already tinged with autumn’s earliest rust, even though the air still clung to late-summer warmth. Andrew planted a box of computer-science textbooks on the curb, straightened, and rolled his shoulder until the joint popped. His phone buzzed with a text.

Nat: Five minutes out. Don’t lift the heavy stuff without me. 💪

He smiled despite himself. Even after three summers of lifeguarding and four years of nursing-program weight-training classes, Natalie insisted on proving she could hoist more than he could.

Andrew: Too late. Herculean feats already in progress.

Nat: If you herniate a disk before Labor Day, I’m prescribing “I told you so.”

He was still grinning when a minivan squealed to a stop beside the curb. The passenger door flew open and Natalie came half-hopping, half-dancing onto the sidewalk. Sunlight caught the auburn strands in her ponytail, setting them aflame. She’d cut it shorter since spring, a practical bob that framed her cheekbones, but a few rebellious tendrils escaped, curling against her neck.

“Hold it,” she commanded, lifting both palms. “Step away from the liftgate.”

“Yes, ma’am.” He raised his hands, surrendering. Their dance was familiar: she teased him about protective instincts; he teased her about stubborn independence. Underneath, affection flickered like heat lightening—visible, near, yet never quite striking.

Her mother emerged from the driver’s seat, waving a cheerful greeting before navigating parking mayhem to find a legal spot. Natalie surveyed the pile of boxes he’d stacked beside the dorm entrance.

“Let me guess. All labeled in the order you’ll unpack them?” she said.

“Nope.” He tapped the nearest box. “Alphabetical by file directory name.”

She elbowed him. “Nerd.”

He swallowed the endearment he wanted to add. Love. The word crowded his throat too often around her these days, a secret pet bird fluttering for escape.

Together they ferried his belongings across the lobby. The dorm smelled of fresh paint and industrial floor wax, the last traces of summer renovations. Whenever Natalie brushed past him, her perfume—green apple and something warm—swam through his thoughts, muddling the careful speech he’d rehearsed.

By noon his side of the room looked lived-in: dual-monitor setup glowing on the desk, framed photograph of his mom, Jill, mid-laughter at last Thanksgiving, and an LED constellation of sticky notes along the wall. Natalie wedged her palms against her lower back.

“Lunch?” she asked.

He flicked a glance at the clock. Two hours until the engineering-department mixer. “I was thinking… maybe we could walk first?” His pulse hammered. “To the oak.”

Her face softened. “Andrew, we haven’t even unloaded my stuff yet.”

“Right. Sorry.” He cursed himself. She despised being rushed. But that bench meant everything: the origin of their story, the place he’d scraped A + N with a pocketknife freshman year, half-joking, half-hoping. If he could guide her there again, under the hush of leaves and nostalgia, maybe the words would tumble out.

Natalie’s phone pinged. She scanned the screen and groaned. “Orientation-committee meeting moved up to one. We break into mentor pairs today.” She bit her lip. Mentoring first-years was her favorite volunteer gig; hospital shifts had forced her to miss last semester’s orientation. “Rain-check on the bench? Dinner?”

He nodded, trying to hide his disappointment. “Dinner.”

They parted outside the dorm. Andrew watched until she rounded the corner, then exhaled the breath he’d been holding. He did not believe in omens—except, apparently, when they were spelled in her smile.

A gust riffled the trees overhead, crisp enough to raise gooseflesh. Early fall tended to arrive like that in the northern Adirondacks, thieving color from August even before students unpacked futons.

He headed toward Brewed Awakening, the coffee shop wedged between the library and the student-services wing. Last year he’d pulled all-nighters there, caffeinated by the house dark roast and Natalie’s late-night test-prep flashcards. Today the shop buzzed with freshmen pointing at pastry cases, faculty cradling first-day lattes, and indie folk music weaving between orders.

Andrew edged forward in line, scanning the chalkboard specials. When he reached the counter, his eyebrows lifted. The barista was new—a girl maybe a year older than him, with sea-green eyes and an asymmetrical pixie cut. A single silver hoop glinted at her left ear. Her nametag read: Ana. No extra “n.”

“What can I get you?” Her tone was polite, practiced. Yet there was something else behind it, the faintest curve of intrigue, as if she recognized him.

“A medium cold brew. Splash of oat milk.” He slid his card across the counter.

She tilted her head. “Mid-August and you’re already drinking winter fuel? Planning ahead?”

He chuckled. “You have no idea.”

Ana keyed in the order but hesitated before returning his card. “Andrew Nolan,” she said softly, reading the name. Something like amusement flickered through her gaze—too fast for him to decipher. “You’ll want a sleeve,” she added, passing him a biodegradable cuff.

Cold brew didn’t require a sleeve, but before he could question it, she turned to the espresso machine. He drifted to the pickup station, fighting the eerie sensation of being studied.

The shop door chimed behind him. A tall figure in a Lakefield sweatshirt swept inside, juggling a campus map and a triple-berry smoothie. He jostled Andrew’s shoulder in passing, mumbling an apology. Andrew’s phone jolted from his pocket, clattering facedown. He stooped to retrieve it, heart thudding. When he straightened, Ana was sliding a cup toward him. His name, spelled flawlessly, arched across the lid in careful, looping script. Beneath it, a tiny storm cloud had been sketched in black marker, rain streaming from its belly.

Weird. He glanced up, but she was already taking the next order. The din swallowed any chance at conversation. He turned the cup in his hand, puzzled, before shaking the moment away. Mysteries could wait.

Outside, golden light puddled on the brick walkway. Andrew sipped, lips pursing. The coffee tasted stronger than usual, smoky yet—he searched for the word—electrical. A buzz zipped along his nerves. Maybe double-brewed. He hastened toward the computer-lab building for a scheduled advising session.

The afternoon unfolded in a blur of syllabi and upper-division requirements. Professors paraded acronyms—AI, ML, CTF—Capture-the-Flag competitions where hackers waged digital war for bragging rights and internship offers. Andrew scribbled notes, glancing up each time he caught Natalie’s laughter floating from across the lecture hall. They shared only two courses this term, but they always found each other, magnets disguised as friends.

By five, his stomach growled. He jogged back to the dorm, hoping to catch Natalie before she snagged cafeteria leftovers. Her door—directly across from his—stood ajar. He knocked lightly and peeked inside.

Chaos greeted him: suitcases yawning, stacks of scrubs on the bed, a half-assembled bookshelf held hostage by two stripped screws. Natalie knelt on the floor, ponytail a frizz halo, scrubbing at a scuff mark with a Magic Eraser.

“I come bearing takeout,” he announced.

She rocked back on her heels, exhaustion flashing in her eyes. “Please tell me you didn’t forget utensils.”

“Twelve-piece sushi combo. Chopsticks included.”

“Marry me,” she deadpanned.

Don’t tempt me, he thought. But instead he said, “Let’s eat somewhere with oxygen.”

They migrated to the quad, settling on a picnic table beneath a canopy of early-turning maples. The sky had darkened to a pensive blue, the horizon rimmed in molten peach. As they unrolled soy-sauce packets, Natalie exhaled. “Remind me why we thought summer break would feel long?”

“Because we’re masochists,” Andrew said. He kept his tone light but cataloged the smudges under her eyes, the subtle slump of her shoulders. She’d pulled double shifts at St. Gabriel’s Oncology Ward all July, sacrificing beach days to shadow nurse supervisors. He admired her grit, but guilt nibbled at him whenever he pictured her under fluorescent lights while he coded algorithms in his parents’ air-conditioned attic.

They ate in companionable silence for several minutes, the quiet filled by cicadas shrilling from distant trees. Natalie sipped ginger ale. “So,” she ventured, “what’s the plan tomorrow? You convinced Mendez to let you TA the freshman coding lab, right?”

“Conditional on maintaining my GPA and not, quote, ‘overcommitting to extracurricular showboating.’” He adopted the professor’s nasally drone, and Natalie laughed, the sound snagging something inside him.

Her phone buzzed. She checked the screen, sighed, and tucked it away.

“Chris?” he asked before he could stop himself.

She took a languid breath. “Yeah. He landed early. Wants to FaceTime.”

A familiar ache clawed Andrew’s chest. Chris Carmichael—the business-major boyfriend who popped in and out of Natalie’s life like a yo-yo. Last spring they’d paused their three-year relationship “to re-evaluate.” Andrew had spent the summer praying the pause would stretch into eternity. He knew wishing for someone else’s heartbreak was rotten karma, but he also knew he couldn’t keep pretending. Not this year.

“Go talk to him,” he managed. “I’ll clean up.”

She searched his face. Something in his voice must’ve betrayed how much he hated the idea, because her expression flickered with apology. “I won’t be long.” She squeezed his hand—too quickly, like reflex—before moving toward the residence hall.

Andrew gathered empty containers, knotted the plastic bag, and tossed it in the recycling bin. Shadows lengthened across the grass, bruising the quad into twilight. He shoved his hands in his hoodie pocket, heart thudding.

Confess. Tonight. Before Chris reels her back in with promises. Before senior-year chaos buries the chance. Words spiraled in his head: You’re my beginning and my home and every algorithm that’s ever mattered. But when he practiced them aloud, they sounded manic, desperate.

He smelled rain before he noticed the clouds—dark bruises swelling beyond the bell tower. Wind snapped through the maples, sending a flurry of copper leaves skittering across the lawn.

By the time Natalie returned, night had washed the sky navy. “Storm’s tracking southwest,” she said, panting. “We’ve got maybe an hour.”

“Plenty of time.” He feigned calm. “Walk with me?”

She studied him, then nodded. They wound along the brick path toward Ashford Bridge, the shortcut to the southern quad. Crickets pulsed in the shrubs. Andrew’s lungs tightened with every step.

He slowed at the foot of the oak, its branches sprawling like an ancient protector. Even in the gloam, he could make out the bench—their bench—nestled in the swoop of the roots. The carving glimmered faintly beneath the lamppost’s halo: A + N.

Natalie traced the initials with a fingertip, smiling. “Your freshman-year charm offensive.”

He swallowed. “It worked, didn’t it?”

She arched a brow. “Define ‘worked.’”

“Well, you’re still here.”

Lightning stitched the clouds to the horizon. Natalie perched on the bench, pulling her knees up beneath her chin. Andrew sat beside her, heart galloping. The air smelled of wet earth and anticipation.

“Natalie…” He inhaled. “There’s something I’ve been wanting to tell you.”

Her head swiveled toward him. Rain speckled her cheeks, silvering the tiny freckles near her nose. “Okay.” The word was soft, but a tremor of caution lurked inside it, as if she sensed the ground shifting.

He opened his mouth—and the chapel bells clanged eight o’clock, shattering the hush. Natalie jumped. “Mentor pairs meet-up at eight-thirty,” she said, checking her phone. “I totally forgot.”

“Skip it.” The plea was out before he could muzzle it.

Her eyebrows knit. “This is the nursing college’s pilot program, Andrew. I proposed it.”

Of course. He dragged a hand through his hair. Timing: the perpetual antagonist. “Right. Go.”

“Come with me,” she offered, though they both knew observers weren’t permitted in the session.

Lightning flickered again, closer this time. Thunder followed, rumbling like distant artillery.

“Better get inside before we drown,” she said.

He forced a smile. “I’ll catch you after.”

She rose, hesitated as if wanting to say more, then jogged toward the administration building. Rain hissed through the oak leaves, dousing the bench, smearing his chance until tomorrow. Tomorrow. The promise tasted metallic.

Fat drops smacked the pavement as he hurried across campus, but instead of heading to his dorm, Andrew found himself homing toward Brewed Awakening. Maybe caffeine would jolt clarity into his tangled thoughts. The café’s neon sign glowed stoically against the dark, though the shop officially closed at eight.

To his surprise, the door yielded under his push. Bells jingled overhead. The lights inside were dimmed to low, casting amber puddles across vacant tables.

Ana stood at the counter, wiping the espresso machine with a damp cloth. She glanced up, unsurprised, as though she’d expected him.

“Long night ahead?” she asked.

“It’s… been a day.” He rubbed rainwater from his arms. “Are you still serving?”

“For a friend, sure.” She motioned to a stool. “Pour-over? Something slower. Rain deserves patience.”

He sank onto the stool, puzzled by the word friend, but exhaustion overrode curiosity. “Pour-over sounds perfect.”

She worked in silence, coaxing steam from a copper kettle, letting the water bloom the grounds in deliberate spirals. The scent curled through the empty shop—chocolate, cedar, plum.

“You didn’t confess,” she said quietly.

The hairs on his neck rose. “Excuse me?”

“To Natalie,” she clarified, eyes intent on the streaming water. “Under the oak.”

He gaped. “Were you following us?” Paranoia spiked—then embarrassment. Campus was small; maybe she’d strolled by. Still, her certainty unsettled him.

She set the kettle down and met his gaze. “Timing is fickle. Storms, bells, shifting calendars. Courage tends to misfire when you need it most.”

He searched her face for mocking, found none. Only an odd twinge of empathy. “Do I know you from somewhere?”

A smile tugged at one corner of her mouth, secretive. “Not yet.”

The pour-over dripped its final bead. She slid the mug toward him. Small letters were inked on the napkin beneath: Some storms ground flights before they form.

He stared, heart pounding. “What does that mean?”

But she was already unlacing her apron, hanging it on a hook. “Coffee’s on the house. Lock up when you’re done—key’s in the door.”

She strode past him, rain slicker draped over one arm.

“Wait,” he called, but the bells chimed once, twice, and she was gone into the downpour.

Andrew stood alone in the hush, mug steaming before him, thunder chewing the horizon. Some storms ground flights before they form. The words vibrated against his ribs, more bone-deep than metaphor.

He should have written them off as cryptic poetry. Instead, they lodged beside the other mystery—the storm cloud sketched on his coffee lid, the way she’d said his name like a familiar lullaby.

The mug warmed his palms. He lifted it to his lips, tasted plum and cedar and something electric, the flavor of crossroads. Rain hammered the windows, as if urging him to move, to change, to tear open the future before it calcified into regret.

Tomorrow, he promised the night. Tomorrow under the oak, he would finish what this heartbeat had interrupted.
And yet, even as the vow formed, the echo of Ana’s voice threaded the storm: Timing is fickle.

He wasn’t sure whether it was a warning or a blessing. Only that senior year had already begun rewriting itself, and he stood at the first sentence, pen shaking, heart wide as the dark.
