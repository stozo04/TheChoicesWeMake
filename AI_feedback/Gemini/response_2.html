    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Soft Accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tab-based interface is chosen for clear separation between distinct conceptual areas of the novel's plan: the Core Concept, Catalyst Events, Chapter Breakdown, and a QA Checklist. This allows a user (author/editor) to focus on one aspect at a time (e.g., plot structure) without being overwhelmed by the full document. The chapter view is the centerpiece, designed as an interactive timeline, which is more intuitive for understanding narrative flow than a simple list. Clicking a chapter reveals its detailed summary in a modal-like pane, keeping the user anchored in the timeline view. This structure prioritizes usability and a focused, non-linear exploration of the story's architecture. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Chapter List -> Goal: Show narrative progression -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive HTML/CSS Timeline -> Interaction: Click to expand details -> Justification: More intuitive and visually engaging for understanding story flow than a static list. Report Info: Catalyst Events -> Goal: Compare high-stakes choices -> Viz/Presentation: Tabbed content cards -> Interaction: Click tabs to switch -> Justification: Allows for easy side-by-side comparison of the core plot drivers. Report Info: Narrative Pacing -> Goal: Visualize the balance of story beats -> Viz/Presentation: Bar Chart (Chart.js) showing tension/intimacy -> Interaction: Hover for details -> Justification: Provides a quick, scannable overview of the story's emotional rhythm. All diagrams are built with HTML/Tailwind. -->
