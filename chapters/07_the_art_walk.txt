Chapter 7: The Art Walk
A lightness filled Andrew, as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. The grueling project deadline was finally behind him, and the thought of the evening ahead brought a hint of a smile to his lips. He stood in front of the mirror, buttoning his shirt slowly, each button a small ritual to steady himself. Tonight was the annual Art Walk—a tradition he and Natalie had cherished since freshman year.
Reaching for his cologne, he smiled at Natalie's familiar advice: Just enough to notice, not enough to remember.
The buzz of his phone against the dresser shattered the moment.His mother's name illuminated the screen, accompanied by a photo of her laughing in their backyard garden, her hands covered in soil, her face lit with joy. Something twisted in his stomach—a premonition, perhaps, or just anxiety finding its mark. She never called at this hour. Never.
The phone continued its insistent rhythm, each vibration more ominous than the last. Andrew's hand hovered over it, his reflection in the mirror showing a flash of fear he quickly tried to suppress. She always texts first. Always asks if I'm free to talk. His throat tightened as he picked up the phone, its smooth surface cool against his suddenly warm palm.
"Hey, Mom," he greeted, attempting to keep his tone light. "What's up?"
"Hi, honey," his mother's voice flowed through the line, a forced cheerfulness failing to mask the tremor beneath. "I just wanted to check in, see how you're doing." 
Andrew's fingers found the edge of the dresser, gripping the polished wood until his knuckles turned white. "I'm good," he replied, the lie tasting bitter on his tongue. "Just getting ready to meet Natalie for the Art Walk." Please let everything be okay. Please.
There was a pause—a heavy, lingering silence that set his nerves on edge. "Well, actually... I got some news from the doctor today."
A heavy weight settled in Andrew's chest, pressing against his ribs as if trying to escape. "What kind of news?" he asked, his voice barely more than a whisper.
Time seemed to stretch thin, each second an eternity. "It's... it's not the best news, sweetheart," she confessed, her voice fragile like cracked porcelain. "The tests came back, and they found cancer. But listen, we're exploring treatment options. We're going to tackle this head-on."
Cancer. The word echoed in his mind. The room around him blurred, colors bleeding together like a watercolor left in the rain. His mother was still speaking—something about treatment options and tackling things head-on—but her voice seemed to come from very far away, as if he were underwater, sinking deeper with each passing second.
"Andrew? Are you there?" Her voice broke through the haze, anchoring him back to the moment.
He swallowed hard, forcing words past the lump in his throat. "Yeah, Mom, I'm here. I just... I don't know what to say."
"It's going to be okay," she assured him, though her tone wavered. "I don't want you to worry. We'll get through this together."
Together. But they weren't together, were they? She was there, in their family home, probably sitting in her favorite armchair by the window, while he stood here, useless, surrounded by the trappings of his college life that suddenly seemed impossibly trivial.


"I love you, Mom," he whispered, his eyes stinging with unshed tears.
"I love you too, sweetheart. Don't worry too much. We'll take this one step at a time."
After the call ended, silence flooded the room like a physical presence. Andrew sank onto the edge of his bed, the springs creaking softly beneath his weight. The phone slipped from his fingers onto the comforter, screen now dark, as if it too were in mourning.
In the mirror across the room, his reflection stared back—a young man on the precipice of his twenty-first birthday, now holding a weight no celebration could lighten. The carefully chosen outfit, the meticulously applied cologne, the excited anticipation of seeing Natalie—all of it felt like artifacts from another life, one that had ended with a single phone call.
I should be there with her, the thought crashed through him like a wave. Not here, not pretending everything is normal. But even as the thought formed, he knew what his mother would say: that life doesn't stop, that she needed him to keep going, to stay strong.
Standing slowly, he straightened his shirt one final time, a gesture that felt both futile and necessary. The Art Walk awaited. Natalie awaited. And somehow, he would have to find a way to navigate this new reality where everything looked the same but nothing was.
Stepping outside, the crisp evening air struck Andrew's face, sharp and biting—a stark counterpoint to the numbness enveloping his heart. The scent of blooming jasmine and freshly cut grass mingled around him, fragrances that once brought comfort now barely registering. Lanterns hung from the trees lining the path to campus, their soft glow casting intricate patterns on the cobblestone walkway. In the distance, the faint strumming of a guitar added a melancholic melody to the night.
As he approached the entrance of the Art Walk, the vibrant colors and lively chatter seemed to exist in another world. Natalie stood by the gate, her smile warm and radiant, a beacon amidst the chaos swirling within him.
"There you are!" Natalie exclaimed, wrapping her arms around him. "Free at last from the tyranny of deadlines. How does it feel?"
Andrew managed a weak smile, but it crumbled as his eyes welled up. He quickly looked away, but not before Natalie caught the glimmer of a tear.
Her brow creased with concern. "Hey," she said softly, placing a hand on his arm. "What's wrong?"
He took a shaky breath, words tumbling out before he could stop them. "It's... it's my mom. She just called. The doctor said..." His voice broke. "She has cancer, Nat."
Natalie's eyes widened, filled with sympathy. Without hesitation, she pulled him into a tight embrace. "Oh, Andrew," she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. "I'm so sorry."
He leaned into her, the warmth of her hold offering a brief respite from the cold dread inside him. "I don't know what to do," he admitted, his words muffled against her shoulder.
She pulled back just enough to look into his eyes. "You don't have to go through this alone," she assured him, her hand still resting on his arm. "I'm here for you."
They began to walk, the festive atmosphere around them a stark contrast to the heaviness they carried. As they passed vibrant paintings and sculptures, the art blurred into a swirl of colors. Andrew's thoughts drifted to an image of his mother sitting alone in a stark, white examination room—the harsh fluorescent lights casting deep shadows under her weary eyes. He could almost smell the antiseptic air, feel the cold plastic chair beneath him.
Natalie stole glances at Andrew, her heart tightening at the sight of his pained expression. Why does seeing him like this affect me so much? she wondered. And why can't I shake this feeling that being with him feels more right than anything I've felt with Chris lately?
They paused before a sprawling mural where vibrant hues burst forth from a shadowy abyss—the colors dancing and clashing like tumultuous waves. Andrew stared at it, the chaos on the wall mirroring the turmoil within his soul. "This one speaks to me," he whispered, his voice barely audible over the hum of the crowd.
Natalie followed his gaze. "It's powerful," she agreed softly. "Like it's capturing a storm trying to find its calm."
He nodded, the weight of his emotions pressing heavily. "I just don't want to lose her," he admitted, his voice cracking.
Natalie tightened her grip on his hand. "You won't," she assured him, her voice steady. "We'll face this together."
A gentle breeze rustled the leaves above, carrying the faint scent of rain. Natalie glanced at the darkening horizon. "Looks like a storm might be coming," she remarked.
They continued toward a quieter part of the Art Walk, where a small wooden bridge arched over a serene pond. The bridge creaked softly under their feet, its railings adorned with carvings and entwined with ivy. Lanterns hung along the sides, their reflections shimmering in the water below.
"Remember studying here?" Natalie grinned, her eyes twinkling in the soft light.
Andrew chuckled, though the sound was lighter than before. "Studying? More like I distracted you with random trivia."
She laughed, the melody of it easing some of the tension in his chest. "Exactly. You always knew how to make me laugh, even when I didn't want to."
He glanced at her, a softness in his gaze. "You've always been there for me, Nat. I don't know what I'd do without you."
She looked away briefly, her cheeks flushing. "Same here," she murmured.
Natalie paused, her fingers tracing over the rough surface of the railing where initials were encircled by a heart. She gently pushed aside a trailing vine, revealing the letters "A+N."
"Look at this," she whispered, her voice tinged with wonder.
Andrew leaned in, his shoulder brushing against hers. "Well, that's a coincidence," he mused, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. "Andrew and Natalie."
She glanced up at him. "Or fate," she suggested softly, the word hanging between them like a delicate thread.
"This bridge has always felt special," Natalie continued. "Like it's a gateway between what was and what could be."
Andrew traced the carved heart with his fingertips. "Maybe it's been waiting for us to notice," he said, feeling a strange sense of destiny.
The space between them seemed to shrink, the air thick with anticipation. Andrew could hear his own heartbeat, loud and insistent. He leaned in slightly, caught in the pull of her gaze. "Natalie, I..." he began, but the words caught in his throat.
She held his gaze, her eyes reflecting the warm glow of the lanterns. "Yes?" she prompted gently.
He hesitated, the enormity of his feelings battling with the complications of reality. "I'm just... grateful to have you in my life," he finished, the unspoken words lingering in the air.
She smiled softly, a hint of disappointment flickering across her features. "Me too, Andrew."
Their hands brushed again, and this time neither pulled away. A warmth spread through Andrew's arm, igniting a flutter in his chest. Natalie seemed to notice too; her cheeks flushed ever so slightly, but she kept her hand close, fingers lightly touching his.
"There's something about tonight," she said quietly. "Being here with you... it feels right."
He nodded, his voice barely more than a whisper. "I feel it too."
But before the moment could deepen, reality intruded. A distant roll of thunder echoed, reminding them of everything left unresolved.
Natalie looked away, a shadow crossing her face. "Things with Chris have been... difficult," she admitted, her gaze drifting to the rippling water below. "Lately, it feels like we're speaking different languages."
"Maybe you just need to find common ground," Andrew suggested softly.
She looked up, meeting his eyes. "Maybe," she said, her tone uncertain. "Or maybe I need to listen to what my heart is really saying."
Andrew swallowed, unsure of how to respond. "You deserve to be happy," he said finally.
She gave a small nod. "So do you."
A flash of lightning illuminated the sky, followed by a gentle rumble of thunder. "We should probably head back before the storm hits," Natalie suggested.
"Good idea," he replied.
As they made their way back, walking side by side, their fingers occasionally grazed each other—a fleeting touch that sent a subtle thrill coursing through Andrew. Each accidental brush felt charged, the air between them thick with words unspoken.
"By the way," she began, a flicker of mischief in her eyes. "You do realize your birthday is tomorrow, right?"
Andrew blinked, momentarily caught off guard. "Tomorrow? I guess it slipped my mind."
She laughed, a melodic sound that lifted the weight from his shoulders, if only for a moment. "Of course you did. But you can't escape that easily. You still owe me our promise from sophomore year."
He hesitated, searching his memory. "Promise?"
"Oh, come on! Don't tell me you forgot," she teased. "I sat through three Star Wars movies for you. In return, you promised that on your twenty-first birthday, I'd get to take you out for your first legal drink."
"You remembered?" he asked, amusement coloring his tone.
"Absolutely. I've been counting down the days to witness the legendary Andrew Nolan finally embrace his wild side," she declared with a playful wink. "And don't even think about backing out—I have your promise in writing, complete with your signature."
He chuckled, the sound genuine. "Alright, alright. A deal's a deal. But don't expect me to suddenly turn into a party animal."
"We'll see about that," she replied, nudging him lightly. "Who knows? Maybe there's a wild side under all that seriousness."
He shook his head, smiling. "You're relentless."
"I prefer determined," she countered.
As they approached the end of the Art Walk, the first drops of rain began to fall, speckling the pavement. Andrew looked up, letting the cool droplets kiss his face. "Seems the storm's finally here."
Natalie glanced up at the darkening sky. "Of course it decides to rain now," she sighed.
The rain intensified, droplets turning into a steady shower. They dashed across the street, laughter bubbling up as they narrowly avoided puddles. Reaching the awning, they huddled beneath it, the space just wide enough for the two of them.
She shook her head, droplets flying from her hair. "Well, this feels familiar," she mused, a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.
Andrew grinned, warmth spreading in his chest. "Déjà vu, anyone?"
Their laughter mingled, filling the small space between them with warmth and familiarity. The rain drummed steadily against the awning, creating a soothing rhythm.
She sighed contentedly. "It's funny how some things don't change."
He glanced at her, the soft light from a nearby street lamp illuminating her features. "Yeah," he agreed. "Though some things do."
She met his gaze, something unspoken passing between them. "Andrew," she began softly, "how are you holding up? Really?"
He took a deep breath, the reality of his mother's illness pressing at the edges of his thoughts. "It's hard," he admitted. "I'm scared, and I feel helpless being so far away from her. But being here with you... it helps."
She reached out, her fingers gently brushing his. "I'm glad," she whispered. "I wish there was more I could do."
"You being here is enough," he replied, his eyes searching hers. "I don't know what I'd do without you."
Their hands remained touching, the contact sending a subtle thrill through him. The air between them seemed to thicken, filled with possibilities and unspoken feelings.
"Do you ever think about that day?" she asked suddenly. "About how things might have been different if we hadn't both sought shelter at the same spot?"
"All the time," he confessed. "It's like the universe conspired to bring us together."
She smiled softly. "Maybe it did."
A silence settled over them, comfortable yet charged. The rain continued its steady descent, the world outside their little haven blurred and distant.
He hesitated before speaking again. "Natalie, there's something I've been meaning to tell you..."
Before he could continue, a sudden gust of wind blew a spray of rain under the awning, causing them both to step back and laugh.
"Seems like the weather doesn't want you to spill your secrets," she teased, her eyes sparkling.
He chuckled. "Maybe not."
She shivered slightly, rubbing her arms. "It's getting a bit chilly."
Without thinking, he shrugged off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders. "Here."
"Always the gentleman," she remarked, pulling it around herself. "Thank you."
"Anytime," he replied, stuffing his hands into his pockets.
She looked up at him, her expression thoughtful. "You know, despite everything going on, I'm glad we have moments like this."
"Me too," he said sincerely. "It reminds me of what's important."
A flash of lightning lit up the sky, followed by a rumble of thunder. The suddenness of it interrupted the moment, and they both looked out toward the storm.
"Maybe we should make a run for it," she suggested, her tone lightening. "Before the weather gets worse."
He nodded, though part of him wanted to stay in that moment forever. "Your place isn't too far. Let's go."
They dashed out from under the awning, rain immediately soaking through their clothes. Laughter bubbled up as they splashed through puddles, the cold water contrasting with the warmth between them.
Reaching her apartment building, they ducked under the entrance's overhang, breathless and dripping.
Silence fell between them again, charged with the weight of unspoken words.
She took a small step closer. "Andrew, thank you for tonight. For everything."
"Always," he replied, his voice steady despite the turmoil inside.
She hesitated before standing on her tiptoes and pressing a soft kiss to his cheek. Her lips lingered for a moment longer than usual, sending a warm rush through him.
"Goodnight," she whispered, her breath brushing against his skin.
"Goodnight, Natalie," he managed to say.
She turned and entered the building, leaving him standing there with a mix of emotions he couldn't quite untangle.
As he walked back to his dorm, the rain easing into a gentle drizzle, he replayed the evening in his mind. The shared memories, the laughter, the closeness—they all pointed to something more than friendship.
Maybe, he thought, some things are meant to change.
