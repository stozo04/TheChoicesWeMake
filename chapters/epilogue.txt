Epilogue
The crisp autumn air danced with the scent of damp earth and fallen leaves as Anna knelt beside her grandparents' grave, placing fresh flowers gently against the headstone. A quiet breeze tugged at her white coat, the embroidered “Dr. Anna Nolan” catching the sunlight—a promise fulfilled.
“Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa,” she whispered, her fingers brushing the cool stone. Her hand drifted to her still-flat stomach. “I have some news. You’re going to be great-grandparents.”
Her smile quivered as tears pooled in her emerald eyes. “I wish you both could’ve met me—all of me,” she murmured. “I wish you could’ve seen how your legacy grew, how it became something bigger than any of us could’ve imagined.”
She paused, tracing Jill’s and Jim’s names etched into the granite, the lines softened by time. “Your son,” she began softly, addressing Jim now, “he became the father I always knew he could be. Everything I did—crossing time, guiding him—it was worth it. Growing up with his love, his belief in me…” She swallowed, the emotion thick in her throat. “I think you always knew, deep down, what he could become. What we all could.”
Anna rose slowly, brushing off the damp leaves clinging to her coat. She lingered for a moment longer, letting the stillness of the cemetery embrace her, the quiet presence of Jill and Jim feeling as real as ever. The drive from their resting place to the university hospital was familiar. She had traveled this road so many times, and each passing mile felt like a thread connecting the past to the future, one generation to the next.
Her thoughts drifted to her parents, as they did every month. Saturdays had always been sacred—a pilgrimage to honor Jill and Jim before making the long drive to visit the hospital where their legacies lived on. Now, the ritual was hers to carry, too.
The winding road seemed shorter than usual, her memories guiding her forward. Anna parked in the campus lot, her fingers lightly grazing the steering wheel as she recalled the many times her parents had made this same journey. On early Saturday mornings, like clockwork each month, they’d leave with soft smiles and return later in the day, their hands intertwined, somehow stronger after having touched both grief and joy.
She spotted them across the quad, her heart warming at the sight. Hand in hand, they walked toward the hospital—their ritual, their quiet strength as comforting as ever. Her father’s fingers traced the familiar bench, the one where they had carved "A&N" all those years ago. Even after two decades, they still returned to that spot, the place where their love had been etched into wood and memory alike. They never knew Anna had shared those moments across time.
Her pager buzzed softly—a reminder of rounds waiting for her—but for just a moment longer, she stood still, watching her parents from a distance. They had weathered so much—love, loss, and the weight of time itself. And through it all, they had come out stronger, their love a quiet force that endured.
Some choices, Anna had learned, echo through time, rippling across lives in ways we can’t always see until they come full circle. And sometimes those ripples become waves, carrying hope to places we never imagined.
She placed a hand over her stomach, feeling the quiet life growing within her. Another beginning. Another healer. Another link in the chain her great-grandparents had started. Time, she knew now, wasn’t a line but a circle—endless, looping, drawn by hearts brave enough to love across any distance, any barrier, any impossible space between what was and what could be.
And their circle? It was just beginning again.
