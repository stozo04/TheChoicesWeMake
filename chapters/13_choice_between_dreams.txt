Chapter 13: Dreams and Sacrifices


Andrew slouched in his desk chair, mindlessly refreshing his email while restaurant reviews filled his laptop screen. The Little Venice had a 4.8-star rating, with everyone raving about their garden seating. "Most romantic spot in town," one review claimed. Perfect.


He'd already confirmed their reservation three times this week. Table 12, outside, under the string lights. He pulled up the menu again, making mental notes about wine selections. Natalie preferred white, something sweet but not too sweet. Maybe the moscato they'd tried at his birthday...


His phone buzzed with a text from Natalie:


"Do I need to dress fancy fancy or just fancy? 😊"


He smiled, typing back: "Whatever makes you comfortable. But they do have tablecloths..."


The email notification popped up just as he hit send. His heart stopped at the subject line:


TECH INNOVATORS INTERNSHIP PROGRAM - ACCEPTANCE


His hands shook as he clicked open:


"Dear Mr. Nolan,


Congratulations! We are pleased to inform you that you have been selected for the Tech Innovators Internship Program..."


The words blurred as joy rushed through him. He'd done it. Actually done it. The program he'd dreamed about since freshman year, the opportunity that could set up his entire career...


"The next steps will be to visit our campus this Friday. We will introduce you to the team and project you'll be working on, as well as complete necessary drug testing and security clearance..."


Friday.


The elation in his chest crashed into a wall of realization. This Friday. As in, two days from now. As in, the same night he was supposed to take Natalie to dinner. The same night he'd been planning for months. The night that was supposed to be perfect, especially with her fighting that stomach bug lately...


He scrolled through the rest of the email:


"Flight and hotel arrangements will be handled by our team... email to follow shortly... excited to have you join..."


His dream job. Everything he'd worked for. And it had to be this Friday?


Andrew leaned back in his chair, running his hands through his hair. The Little Venice confirmation email still sat open in another tab, mocking him. Table 12. String lights. The beginning of everything he'd hoped for with Natalie.


His phone buzzed again. Another text from her:


"Found the perfect dress 💕"


Andrew stared at the message, his heart twisting. How was he supposed to tell her? How could he choose between the biggest opportunity of his career and their first real date - the one thing he'd promised would be perfect?


He looked back at the acceptance email, the words "Congratulations" and "Friday" seeming to pulse on the screen. Everything he'd ever wanted, landing exactly when he couldn't want it less.


Everything he'd ever wanted, landing exactly when he couldn't want it less.


Andrew stared at his phone, at Natalie's text about the perfect dress, until the screen went dark. He couldn't do this over text. Couldn't call. Some moments needed to be face to face, even if they were moments you dreaded.


His feet carried him across campus on autopilot, following the path they'd taken countless times before. She'd be at their bench now - she always studied there between her afternoon classes, claiming the sunlight was better than the library's fluorescent glare.


Sure enough, as he approached the east side of campus, he saw her. The afternoon sun caught in her hair as she sat there, her textbook unopened beside her. Instead, she was tracing their carved initials with one finger, lost in thought. "A&N" - such simple letters holding so much meaning. A half-empty ginger ale sat beside her - she was still fighting that stomach bug.


"Hey," he said softly, his heart twisting at how fragile she looked in that moment, her finger still absently moving over their engraved history.


Natalie looked up, quickly pulling her hand away from the carved letters as if caught doing something private. "Hey yourself." Her smile brightened her tired features. "I thought you had that coding project to finish?"


He settled beside her on the bench, his own fingers finding their way to the initials she'd just been tracing. "I, uh, got an email."


Something in his tone made her turn to face him fully. "The internship?"


He nodded, and despite the weight in his chest, he couldn't help the smile that spread across his face. "I got it."


"Andrew!" She threw her arms around him, her textbook sliding forgotten to the ground. "Oh my god, I knew you would! I'm so proud of you!"


The pure joy in her voice made what he had to say next even harder. He pulled back slightly, keeping her hands in his, their fingers intertwined over the carved "A&N."


"There's just one thing..." He watched her face carefully. "They want me to fly out for the in-person orientation. This Friday."


He felt her freeze for just a fraction of a second before understanding dawned in her eyes. "Friday? As in..."


"Yeah." His thumb traced the ampersand between their initials. "I know it's our date, and I've been planning it forever, and you haven't been feeling well, and-"


"Andrew." She placed her free hand over his where it rested on their carved letters, stilling his nervous movement. "This is your dream."


"But-"


"No buts." Her voice was firm, though he caught something flickering behind her eyes - something that looked almost like fear, but then she smiled and it was gone. "This is everything you've worked for. Everything you deserve."


"I'll reschedule," he promised, pulling her closer. "The restaurant isn't going anywhere. We'll do it right - next weekend, when I get back. Even more special."


Natalie leaned her head against his shoulder, their hands still joined over those two simple letters that meant everything. "Just promise me one thing?"


"Anything."


"Promise me you'll knock their socks off."


He pressed a kiss to the top of her head, overwhelmed by her support, by how lucky he was to have someone who understood him so completely. "I love you," he whispered into her hair.


She tightened her grip on his hand, and he felt something wet fall onto their joined fingers - a tear. But when she looked up, she was smiling. "I love you too. Now go call them back before they change their minds."


As he stood to leave, she remained on the bench, one hand still resting on their carved initials, the other pressed almost protectively against her stomach - a gesture he was too distracted to notice.












Andrew walked away from the bench with his heart both lighter and heavier. Natalie's support meant everything, but something about her tears, even happy ones, tugged at his conscience. He pulled out his phone, already planning how to make the rescheduled date even more special. Maybe he could book a private room at Little Venice, make it even more intimate...


"Things are happening fast now, Andrew."


He stopped mid-step, that familiar chill running down his spine. Great. Just great. The very person who almost ruined everything with Natalie two days ago. The reason he'd almost lost her before they'd even really begun. Anna stood in his path, more urgent than he'd ever seen her. Gone was her usual cryptic calm, replaced by something that looked almost like fear.


Everything's accelerating, Anna thought. Too fast. Too soon. If he'd only understand what was really at stake.


"Not now, Anna." He tried to step around her, anger seeping into his voice. "Haven't you caused enough trouble? Natalie saw us at the café, you know. She thought... she almost..." He couldn't even finish the sentence, remembering how close he'd come to losing Natalie over this mysterious girl's cryptic appearances.


"Listen to me." She moved to block his path, her emerald eyes intense. "Everything is accelerating. The choices you make now will change everything." Please see it, she silently pleaded. See what's right in front of you. See her.


Andrew let out a humorless laugh. "Yeah, well, I just chose my dream job over my dream girl - the same girl who almost walked away because of you and your mysterious warnings." He attempted to inject some lightness into his voice, trying to mask the lingering hurt. "Still waiting on that lottery win this weekend, by the way. That would solve at least a few problems." Always deflecting with humor, he thought. Just like Grandpa taught you. When things get heavy, make them laugh.




The lottery numbers. Anna's heart ached. Such a small thing to prove my trust, but carrying a heavy price. But there was no time to dwell on past mistakes. "This isn't a joke, Andrew. You need to listen to your heart. Really listen."


"My heart?" He ran a hand through his hair in frustration. Why can't she just speak plainly for once? "My heart is sitting back there on that bench, telling me to chase my dreams while she fights off whatever bug she's caught. My heart is trying to figure out how to be in two places at once this Friday. So excuse me if I'm not in the mood for your cryptic warnings right now."


Not a bug, Anna wanted to scream. Look closer. See the signs. But she couldn't. Some truths had to be discovered, not told.


"You will see that I'm telling the truth," Anna's voice softened, something almost like sympathy crossing her features. "Just as I am now. The signs are all around you, if you'd only pay attention."


"Signs?" He threw his hands up. God, you're impossible. Always speaking in riddles, always showing up at the worst moments. "The only signs I'm seeing are pointing me in opposite directions!"


If you only knew how many directions are actually in play, Anna thought sadly.


"Then maybe you're looking at them wrong." She stepped closer, and for a moment, that strange familiarity in her features made his head spin. Why does she always remind me of... "The choices you make will change everything, Andrew. Everything."


The weight in her words made him pause. There was something different about her today, something more urgent than all their previous encounters. Like she's running out of time, he thought.


"Why do I feel like we're talking about the internship?" he asked quietly.


We always were, Anna thought, already backing away..


But all she said was, "Your heart knows more than you think it does. Listen to it."


Before he could respond, she was gone, leaving him alone with her warning echoing in his mind and the ghost of Natalie's tears still wet on his fingers. Great, he thought, running his hand through his hair again. Because I didn't have enough to worry about already.


Andrew's hands shook slightly as he pulled up the flight details on his laptop. Friday morning departure. Security clearance. Drug testing. Project briefing. Every item on the itinerary was another step toward his dream - so why did Anna's words keep echoing in his head?


The choices you make will change everything.


His phone lit up with another text from Natalie: "Already looking at next weekend's reservation times 💕"


A smile tugged at his lips. How did he get so lucky? Here he was, canceling their first real date, the one he'd been planning for months, and instead of being upset, she was helping him reschedule. Supporting his dreams when she could have easily made him feel guilty.


He opened the Little Venice website again, this time looking at private dining rooms. Next weekend would be even better. More special. He'd make sure of it. Maybe by then whatever bug she was fighting would be gone, and they could really celebrate - both the internship and them. Everything was finally falling into place.


Well, almost everything. That nagging feeling from his encounter with Anna lingered, like a word caught on the tip of his tongue. Something about the urgency in her eyes today...


He shook his head, pushing the thought away. No more cryptic warnings. No more mysteries. Just his dream job and his dream girl. What more could he want?


Natalie sat on her dorm room floor, back against the bed, staring at the pregnancy test hidden in her desk drawer. Her other hand rested on her stomach, the reality of what grew there still impossible to grasp.


"The choices you make will change everything."


She hadn't meant to overhear Anna's words to Andrew, but they carried across the quad as she'd watched their interaction from the bench. How fitting those words were, when she held the biggest choice of all inside her.


Her phone buzzed - Andrew sending links to restaurant reviews for next weekend. Always planning, always trying to make things perfect. She could picture him now, probably already looking at private dining rooms, wanting to make up for postponing.


If he only knew there wouldn't be a next weekend. Not like he imagined. Not once she told him the truth.


She pulled out the test, looking at those two pink lines that had changed everything. By the time he returned from his interview, their whole world would be different. No amount of string lights or garden seating could make this conversation romantic.


"I'm proud of you," she whispered to her phone, to his excited texts about flight details. And she was. God, she was. He deserved this opportunity, deserved to chase his dreams before...


Before.


She slipped the test back into the drawer, wiping fresh tears from her cheeks. One hand remained on her stomach, protecting the secret that would change everything. Just not yet. Not today. Today was his moment, his dream. Her news could wait just a little longer.


After all, some changes you can't prepare for, no matter how many warnings you get.
