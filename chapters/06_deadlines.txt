Chapter 6: Deadlines
The library clock ticked relentlessly as Andrew hunched over his laptop, the blue glow casting shadows under his eyes. The deadline for his internship project loomed, keeping him glued to his seat. He rubbed his eyes, trying to stay focused.
His phone vibrated, breaking the silence. A text from Natalie lit up the screen: Still burning the midnight oil? Don't forget to breathe, genius.
A tired smile crept onto his lips. Thanks for the reminder. This project is kicking my butt.
Want some company? I've got coffee and your favorite snacks, came her reply.
Andrew hesitated. He should keep working, but the thought of Natalie sitting across from him, easing the weight of his exhaustion, was too tempting to resist. Besides, since Chris's call last Saturday, they hadn't really talked. "You're a lifesaver, Meet you at our usual spot in 10?" he responded, his heart quickening.
Fifteen minutes later, they sat across from each other in a quiet corner of the library. The smell of fresh coffee and the dusty scent of old books mingled, creating a pocket of warmth against the late-night grind.
"You look like you're about to pass out," Natalie teased, sliding him a cup of coffee. "When's the last time you took a break?"
Andrew ran a hand through his messy hair. "Uh, what day is it again?"
She laughed softly, but concern flickered in her eyes. "Come on, Andrew. You need to pace yourself or you'll burn out."
He took a long sip of coffee, grateful for the warmth. "I know, but this project could make or break my internship chances. And with everything else going on..."
The hours stretched on, their conversation meandering from the project to shared memories and campus gossip. For those few precious hours, the weight on Andrew's shoulders felt lighter, thanks to Natalie's companionship.
The following afternoon, Andrew found himself in Professor Mendez's office, nervously presenting his project progress. The professor listened intently, his keen eyes following Andrew's gestures as he explained the intricacies of his work.
"You've made solid progress, Andrew," Professor Mendez said, leaning back in his chair. "But I sense there's something holding you back. What's on your mind?"
Andrew hesitated, then sighed. "It's just... There's a lot going on, Professor. The project deadline, the internship application.. everything feels overwhelming"
Professor Mendez nodded, a look of understanding crossing his features. "You know, this reminds me of a project you worked on in my class during your junior year. Do you remember?"
Andrew nodded, recalling the challenging assignment.
"You were struggling at first, feeling overwhelmed by the complexity. But do you remember what happened?"
"I pulled it together in the end," Andrew said, a small smile forming.
"And you'll do it again," Professor Mendez said with a warm smile. "Trust yourself."
Andrew stepped out of the office, the weight on his chest feeling a little lighter. His professor's words circled in his mind, reminding him of his past resilience. He could do this—finish the project, handle the internship pressure.
Sometimes, he realized, the greatest strength comes not from having all the answers, but from having someone who believes in your ability to find them.
Pushing through the heavy doors, Andrew stepped out into the warm afternoon air. The campus quad was alive with activity. The tension in his shoulders began to ease as he breathed in the energy of the day. 
As his feet carried him through the campus quad and to the secluded garden path, autumn leaves crunched beneath each step. The sweet scent of late-blooming roses pulled him deeper into the garden's embrace. T
That's when he saw her.


Anna sat there, her attention focused on a sketchbook in front of her. Her hand moved gracefully across the page, creating lines and shapes Andrew couldn't quite make out from where he stood. The sight of her, so casually present in his world, made his heart skip a beat.
For a moment, he considered walking away, avoiding another cryptic encounter. But curiosity and a need for answers propelled him forward. With each step, the questions he'd been holding back threatened to burst forth.
As he approached the table, his mouth opened, ready to unleash a torrent of inquiries. But before he could utter a single word, Anna looked up, her green eyes meeting his with an uncanny awareness.
"I just knew you would find me," she said, a small smile playing at the corners of her mouth.
The words hit Andrew like a physical force, stopping him in his tracks. His prepared questions evaporated, replaced by a new wave of confusion and frustration.
"What do you mean, you knew?" Andrew's voice was edged with frustration. "How do you always seem to 'know' what's going to happen?"
Anna's eyes sparkled, a mix of amusement and something deeper—sympathy, maybe. "I've told you before, Andrew. You're just not listening. I know things."
Running a hand through his hair, Andrew scanned the garden, half-expecting hidden cameras or friends ready to reveal a prank. But there was only the rustle of leaves and distant chatter from passing students.
"Listening?" he echoed, his voice rising. "I've been trying to figure out your cryptic warnings since the day we met. You show up, drop vague hints, and disappear. Do you have any idea what I'm dealing with?"
Anna's smile faded, replaced by concern. She closed her sketchbook and gestured to the empty chair across from her. "Why don't you sit down, Andrew? You look... overwhelmed."
He hesitated for a moment, then shook his head, his frustration boiling over. "No, Anna. I'm done. I'm done with your games, your cryptic messages, your disappearing acts. I've got a deadline fast approaching and I can't afford to waste any more time trying to decipher whatever it is you're playing at."
Andrew glared at Anna, his jaw clenched tight. "I have real problems, Anna. My mom is sick, my project's a mess, and you're..." He gestured vaguely at her. "I don't have the luxury of entertaining your...whatever this is."
He ran a hand through his hair, his voice rising. "I thought maybe, just maybe, you actually wanted to help. But I see now that was just wishful thinking on my part."
Anna reached out, her expression pained. "Andrew, please. If you'd just listen-"
"No," he snapped, stepping back from her reach. "I'm done listening. I have to go. I have work to do, deadlines to meet. I can't...I can't do this anymore."
With that, Andrew turned on his heel and stormed off, leaving Anna sitting alone at the table. He didn't look back, even as he felt her eyes boring into his back.
His hands clenched into fists at his sides as he walked, his mind racing. He had to focus, had to get his project done. He couldn't afford any more distractions, no matter how intriguing or frustrating they may be.
Andrew disappeared into the crowd of students, determined to put Anna and her games behind him once and for all. He had work to do, and nothing, not even the mysterious Anna, could deter him from that path.
Anna watched him go, a mix of emotions swirling within her. She understood his frustration, his desperate need for clarity in a world that felt like it was spinning out of control. If only she could tell him everything, explain the reasons behind her cryptic warnings and sudden appearances.
But I can't, she thought, her heart heavy with the weight of secrets. Not yet. It's too dangerous, too unpredictable.
She closed her eyes, memories of a past she couldn't change and a future she was desperate to protect playing behind her eyelids. The stakes were too high, the consequences too great to risk revealing too much too soon.
I'm sorry, Andrew, she whispered in her mind, the words she couldn't say out loud. I know it's hard, but please trust me. I'm only trying to help.
With a heavy sigh, Anna gathered her things and stood, casting one last glance in the direction Andrew had gone. She had to be patient, to trust in the path she'd chosen, even if it meant bearing the burden of knowledge alone.
One step at a time, she reminded herself, taking a deep breath. Guide him, protect him, but don't reveal too much. The future depends on it.
As the hours counted down to midnight, Andrew poured himself into his project, determined to make it the best it could be. Natalie's occasional texts and care packages kept him going, reminding him that he wasn't alone in this struggle.
With mere minutes to spare, Andrew sat in the quiet of his dorm room, his finger hovering over the submit button. The project was done, polished to perfection. All that was left was to send it off into the void and hope for the best.
He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and clicked. The loading bar filled, the file uploaded, and just like that, it was over. Months of hard work, countless sleepless nights, all condensed into a single digital file, now out of his hands.
Andrew leaned back in his chair, a strange mix of exhaustion and relief washing over him. He'd done it. He'd met the deadline, despite everything life had thrown at him. The rest was up to chance, to the whims of faceless internship committees and unknown opportunities.
But for now, at this moment, he could breathe. The weight of the project lifted, leaving behind a tentative sense of accomplishment. Whatever happened next, he knew he'd given it his all.
With a sigh, Andrew closed his laptop and stood, stretching out the kinks in his back. The future was uncertain, but for the first time in hours, he felt a glimmer of hope. He'd faced his demons, met his deadlines, and come out the other side. And that, in itself, was a victory worth celebrating.
