Chapter 8: The Birthday Promise
There are moments in life that feel like turning points, even before they unfold. For Andrew, the simple act of standing before his bedroom mirror on his twenty-first birthday carried the weight of something more – a threshold between what was and what could be.
As he stood before the mirror, adjusting the collar of his navy button-down shirt for what felt like the hundredth time. The face that stared back at him seemed different somehow – older, perhaps, or just more aware of the weight this day carried. Twenty-one. The fabled age of true adulthood, of new freedoms and greater responsibilities. He ran a hand through his short brown hair, trying to tame a stubborn cowlick that refused to cooperate.


His eyes drifted to the phone lying on his dresser, its screen dark and silent. He knew Natalie would be texting soon, finalizing their plans for the evening. The thought of her brought a smile to his lips, chasing away some of the nervous energy that had been building all day. Natalie, with her warm laughter and understanding eyes, who had stood by him through every up and down. Tonight was about celebration, about stepping into this new chapter of his life with his best friend by his side. And yet...


The smile faltered as he caught his reflection again. There was something else there, something more than birthday jitters or anticipation. An undercurrent of worry tugged at the edges of his mind, manifesting in the slight furrow between his brows that seemed to deepen with each passing day. His mother's face flashed in his thoughts – her smile brave but tired, the pallor of her skin a constant reminder of the battle she was fighting. He shook his head, trying to dispel the image. Tonight was supposed to be about joy, about possibility. He wouldn't let his fears overshadow that.


As if summoned by his thoughts, his phone buzzed to life. For a heart-stopping moment, Andrew thought it might be Natalie, but the caller ID displayed "Mom" in bold letters. Taking a deep breath, he answered.


"Hey, Mom," he said, hoping his voice sounded more cheerful than he felt.


"Happy birthday, sweetheart!" Jill's voice came through, warm and full of love despite the slight rasp that illness had introduced. "My baby boy, all grown up. How does it feel to be twenty-one?"


Andrew chuckled, settling onto the edge of his bed. "Thanks, Mom. Honestly? It feels pretty much the same as twenty so far."


There was a pause, filled with all the things neither of them were saying. Andrew could almost see his mother's face, the way her forehead would crease with a mixture of pride and concern.
Jill’s voice softened. "It’s a big night, isn’t it? I know you’ll be with Natalie, but... just keep your wits about you, okay?"
Before Andrew could respond, he heard a familiar gruff voice in the background. "Is that the birthday boy? Let me talk to him!"
There was a shuffling sound, and then his grandfather's booming voice filled the line. "Andrew, my boy! Happy birthday! Twenty-one, eh? I remember my twenty-first like it was yesterday. Your grandmother had to..."
"Dad!" Jill's voice cut in, a mixture of exasperation and amusement. "Let's not give him any ideas."
Andrew couldn't help but laugh, the knot in his chest loosening a bit. "Thanks, Grandpa," he said, grinning despite himself.
"Alright, alright," Jim chuckled. "You have a good time tonight, Andy. But remember..."
"...a Nolan always keeps his wits about him," Andrew finished the familiar phrase, rolling his eyes fondly. "I know, Grandpa. I will."
As the phone was passed back to his mother, Andrew felt a wave of warmth wash over him. Despite everything, despite the worry and the uncertainty, he had this – the unwavering love and support of his family.
"We’ll be careful, I promise. How are you feeling today?" Andrew asked, his throat tightening unexpectedly.
There was a pause, and Andrew could almost hear the soft intake of breath before she spoke. "Oh, you know me... still keeping everyone on their toes," she said lightly, but the slight rasp in her voice betrayed the effort. "But tonight’s your night, sweetheart. You don’t need to worry about me. Just... enjoy yourself."
"Mom—"
"And Andrew..." Her voice softened further, a note of tenderness woven through. "I’m so proud of you."
Andrew smiled, the words settling deep. "Love you, Mom."
"Love you too, honey." The call ended, but her presence lingered, wrapping around him like a warm embrace.
After the call ended, Andrew sat there for a moment, letting the silence settle around him. Then, as if on cue, a text notification lit up his screen:


"On my way! Hope you're ready for an unforgettable night!- Nat"


Reading the message, Andrew felt something shift inside him – a subtle change in the air, like the moment before a storm breaks. He quickly typed back a response, his excitement building once again. As he stood and gave himself one last look in the mirror, he couldn't shake the feeling that Natalie was right – tonight would be unforgettable, though perhaps not in the way either of them expected.


Across town, Natalie stood in front of her closet, tossing clothes onto her bed as she searched for the right outfit. It was just Andrew’s birthday, she told herself. Just a night out. So why did she feel the pressure to look... special?
She finally settled on a light pink shirt, pairing it with her favorite dark jeans. The outfit was casual enough for a birthday celebration but held just enough intention to make her heart skip. As she ran her fingers through her blonde waves, letting them fall naturally around her shoulders, her grandmother's voice echoed in her memory: "When a girl spends this much time getting ready, she's not dressing for the party – she's dressing for someone special."


Her phone buzzed against the wooden surface of her dresser, the sound sharp and intrusive in the quiet room. Natalie's stomach clenched when she saw the name on the screen: Chris. In the reflection of her mirror, she watched her own expression shift, saw the way her shoulders tensed, the subtle hardening around her eyes. Taking a deep breath, she answered.
"Hey, Chris."
"Hey, babe." His voice slurred slightly, the familiar cadence of too many drinks too early in the evening. "What're you up to? I thought maybe we could chat for a while."
Natalie froze, her mascara wand hovering inches from her eye. She could already hear the telltale signs—Chris was drinking again. He always called when he was drunk, always wanting to talk about nothing in particular, and it never failed to push her buttons.
"Tonight?" She kept her voice steady, though her frustration simmered beneath the surface. "Chris, I told you last week. It's Andrew's twenty-first birthday. I'm taking him out, remember?"
The silence on the other end of the line spoke volumes. When Chris finally responded, his tone had cooled noticeably. "Right. Andrew’s birthday. How could I forget?"
"Chris, don't be like that." Natalie watched her reflection sigh, saw the familiar pattern of tension creep into her shoulders. "He's my best friend, and it's a big day for him." The words 'best friend' felt strange on her tongue, somehow both true and not enough.
"Your best friend," Chris repeated, his voice light but with a trace of something darker underneath. "Well, make sure you don’t end up giving him the 'full birthday experience.' Wouldn’t want him getting the wrong idea." His chuckle didn’t quite reach his usual easygoing tone, leaving Natalie with a sinking feeling.
"Why do you have to make this harder than it needs to be?" she said, but the line had already gone dead. Natalie stared at her phone, a mix of anger and guilt swirling in her chest. She pushed it aside, focusing instead on the evening ahead. This was Andrew’s night, and she was determined to make it special for him.
As she put the finishing touches on her makeup, Natalie caught her reflection in the mirror. The girl staring back at her looked excited, yes, but there was something else there too. A sparkle in her eye, a flush in her cheeks that spoke of more than just anticipation for a fun night out. She thought of Andrew—sweet, thoughtful Andrew, who always knew just what to say to make her laugh, who understood her in a way Chris never had.
"Stop it," she whispered to her reflection. Tonight was about celebrating Andrew, nothing more. She grabbed her purse and keys, sending a quick text to let him know she was on her way. As she locked her apartment door behind her, Natalie couldn't shake the feeling that somehow, someway, everything was about to change.


The crisp evening air nipped at Andrew's cheeks as he waited outside his apartment building, hands stuffed in the pockets of his jacket. His eyes scanned the street, looking for any sign of Natalie's car. The nerves that had been building all day seemed to crescendo now, a strange mix of excitement and anxiety swirling in his stomach.


When Natalie's blue sedan finally rounded the corner, Andrew felt his heart skip a beat. She pulled up to the curb, and for a moment, he just stood there, taking in the sight of her through the windshield. Her blonde hair fell in soft waves around her shoulders, and even from a distance, he could see the warm smile that lit up her face.


"Hey, birthday boy!" Natalie called out as she rolled down the window. "Are you going to stand there all night, or are we celebrating?"


Andrew laughed, the sound carrying away some of his nervousness. As he walked to the car, he noticed the way she watched him approach, her eyes following his movement in a way that felt different from their usual greetings. Opening the passenger door, he was immediately enveloped by the familiar scent of her perfume – a subtle, floral fragrance that always reminded him of spring mornings and missed opportunities.


"You look amazing," he said, the words tumbling out before he could stop them. In the warm glow of the dashboard lights, he saw a faint blush color her cheeks, visible even in the dim light. There was a moment, brief but electric, where their eyes met and the air between them seemed to crackle with unspoken possibilities.
"Thanks," she replied softly, her eyes lingering on his face before she turned her attention back to the road. "You clean up pretty well yourself, Nolan. Twenty-one suits you." Her fingers drummed lightly on the steering wheel, a gesture he recognized as one of her nervous habits.
As they pulled away from the curb, Andrew found himself hyperaware of every detail – the way her hair caught the passing streetlights, the subtle curve of her smile when she glanced his way, the familiar scratch in her car's speakers playing that same playlist she'd had since freshman year. Their easy banter flowed as it always had, but underneath ran a current of nervous energy, like static before a storm.
"So," Natalie asked, navigating through the evening traffic with practiced ease, "any birthday wishes in mind?" There was something in her tone, a hint of vulnerability perhaps, that made the question feel weightier than it should have.
Andrew turned slightly in his seat to look at her profile, struck by how the city lights painted patterns across her face. How many times had he sat in this same seat, stealing glances at her while she drove? How many times had he wanted to tell her that his birthday wish had been the same for years now – always about her?
"Maybe one or two," he said instead, his voice softer than he intended. "But you know what they say about birthday wishes – tell anyone and they won't come true."
Natalie's laugh filled the car, but it carried a nervous edge he'd never heard before. "Since when did you become superstitious?" She turned to meet his gaze at a red light, and for a moment, the whole world seemed to narrow to just the two of them, suspended in the warm glow of the dashboard lights.
The moment stretched between them, heavy with words unsaid. Andrew found himself noticing things he'd always tried to ignore – the way her lips parted slightly when she was thinking, the soft blue in her left eye that caught the light just so, the way her fingers gripped the steering wheel a little tighter when she was nervous.
"I guess tonight feels different," he finally said, his words carrying more weight than he'd intended. "Like anything could happen."
The light turned green, but Natalie hesitated for a heartbeat before pressing the accelerator. "Different can be good," she said quietly, almost to herself. Her free hand moved to adjust the radio volume, and her fingers brushed against his knee in a touch so brief he might have imagined it, yet it sent electricity shooting through his entire body.
As they pulled into the parking lot of The Tap House, the neon sign buzzed above them, casting a warm glow over Natalie's features as she turned off the engine. The moment felt suspended, like the pause between heartbeats, heavy with all the things they weren't saying.
"Ready for this?" she asked, her voice softer now, tinged with something that might have been nervousness. Her eyes met his in the dim light, and Andrew found himself falling into them, as he had so many times before.
"Yeah," he said, surprised by the steadiness in his own voice. "I'm ready."
As they stepped out of the car into the cool evening air, Natalie's hand found his, giving it a quick, reassuring squeeze. The simple gesture sent a jolt through him, and he realized that, ready or not, tonight was going to change everything.
The neon lights of The Tap House painted the parking lot in shades of blue and red, and somewhere in the distance, music pulsed like a heartbeat. As they walked toward the entrance, neither of them let go of the other's hand, and in that moment, the whole world seemed to hold its breath, waiting to see what would happen next.
The Tap House buzzed with life, a stark contrast to the quiet intimacy of their car ride. As Andrew pulled open the heavy wooden door, the warmth of bodies and the thrum of music washed over them like a wave. String lights crisscrossed the ceiling, casting a golden glow that made everything feel slightly dreamlike, as if they'd stepped into a world where anything was possible.
The scents of beer and worn leather mingled with the lingering trace of Natalie's perfume as she moved past him into the bar. Andrew found himself watching the way the lights played in her hair, how the pink  of her blouse seemed to come alive in the amber glow. She turned back to look at him, and the smile she gave him made his heart stutter in his chest.
So," Natalie leaned against the polished wood of the bar, tilting her head to study him. "What's your first legal drink going to be? Please don't tell me you've been dreaming of something like a Fuzzy Navel."
Andrew felt a smile tug at his lips as he watched her, remembering all the times they'd joked about this moment. "You know, I've been thinking about this for weeks," he said, his voice dropping slightly as he leaned closer to her. "Figured I'd go for something strong. Something... memorable."
There was a slight pause, the playful tone hanging between them, but Andrew's eyes lingered on hers a little longer than usual. Natalie caught the subtle shift, and her smile softened into something more intimate. "Guess I'll just have to wait and see if you impress me."


The bartender approached – "What can I get you?" he asked, his gaze moving between them with the knowing look of someone who'd witnessed countless first drinks, first dates, first chances.
"Whiskey neat," Andrew said, surprised by the confidence in his voice. "Maker's Mark." It was what his father used to drink, though he didn't say that part aloud. But when he glanced at Natalie, he saw in her eyes that she remembered too – all those stories he'd told her about his dad before he left.
The bartender nodded, a slight smile playing at his lips as he turned to grab the bottles. In that moment of waiting, Andrew became aware of everything at once – the way Natalie's thumb was absently stroking his arm, the sound of someone laughing by the pool tables, the distant twang of a country song he half-recognized, and beneath it all, the steady drumming of his own heart.
When their drinks arrived, amber liquid catching the light like liquid gold, Natalie turned to face him fully. "To twenty-one," she said, raising her glass. But there was something more in her eyes, something that made the simple toast feel like a beginning.
"To tonight," Andrew responded, his voice low enough that only she could hear. Their glasses clinked, the sound somehow cutting through all the ambient noise of the bar. As they both took their first sip, their eyes locked over the rims of their glasses, and Andrew felt the whiskey's warmth spread through his chest, though he wasn't sure if it was the alcohol or the way Natalie was looking at him.
The first taste was sharp, burning, but not unpleasant – like the edge of something new and exciting. Andrew watched as Natalie's nose wrinkled slightly at the taste, a gesture so endearing it made his chest ache. She'd never been much of a whiskey drinker, he knew, but she'd chosen to share this moment with him anyway.
"Well?" she asked, setting her glass down and leaning closer. The movement brought her near enough that he could see the flecks of gold in her eyes, could smell the sweet mixture of her perfume and the whiskey on her breath. "How does it feel to be legal?"
Andrew considered the question, aware of how the space between them seemed to have shrunk, how the bar around them had faded into a comfortable blur of sound and light. "Honestly?" he said, his voice soft but steady. "It feels like standing on the edge of something big. Like everything's about to change."
Natalie's breath caught slightly at his words, and for a moment, the look in her eyes made him wonder if she was thinking about all the same things he was – all the movie nights and coffee runs, all the shared secrets and almost-moments that had led them here.
"Change can be good," she whispered, echoing her words from the car, but this time they carried more weight, more promise. Her hand was still on his arm, her touch burning through his sleeve like a brand.
The opening notes of a familiar song drifted through the speakers, and Andrew watched as recognition lit up Natalie's face. It was the same song they'd danced to at their high school graduation party, the one that had been playing in his car the first time he'd almost kissed her.
"Dance with me?" she asked, already pulling away from the bar, her hand sliding down his arm to intertwine their fingers. 
As Andrew let her lead him toward the small dance floor, he caught their reflection in the mirror behind the bar – the two of them moving together through the golden light, looking for all the world like two people on the verge of falling. Or perhaps, he thought as Natalie turned to face him, her eyes shining with possibility, they'd been falling all along.
TODO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Andrew shook his head, unable to keep the smile off his face. "Yeah, yeah, you were right. As usual." He turned to look at her, taking in the way the stage lights still reflected in her eyes, how her hair had come slightly loose from her careful styling, falling in soft waves around her flushed face.


"What?" she asked softly, catching his gaze.


"I just..." Andrew paused, searching for the right words in a mind hazy with whiskey and emotion. "Thank you, Nat. For tonight, for always being there. For knowing exactly what I need, even when I don't." He swallowed hard, his voice dropping to nearly a whisper. "I don't know what I'd do without you."
Something flickered in Natalie's eyes, an emotion so raw and honest it made his chest ache. She reached out, her fingers brushing his cheek in a touch so gentle it made his breath catch. The gesture was innocent enough, but in that moment, it felt more intimate than any kiss.
"You'll never have to find out," she murmured, her words carrying a weight that seemed to fill the space between them. "I'm not going anywhere, Andy."
The air between them seemed to thicken, charged with years of unspoken words and carefully maintained boundaries that suddenly felt paper-thin. Andrew found himself leaning in, drawn by some invisible force as old as time itself. Natalie's eyes fluttered closed, her lips parting slightly, and the whole world seemed to hold its breath.
TODO!! NO KARAKE
Just then, a raucous cheer erupted from the karaoke stage as a new performer took the spotlight, shattering the moment. They both jumped, startled by the sudden noise. Andrew cleared his throat, feeling a blush creep up his neck even as his skin still tingled where Natalie had touched him.
"Let's find a quiet place to sit?" he suggested, his voice slightly hoarse. The words came out as a question, heavy with possibilities.
As they made their way around the back corner of The Tap House away from the main crowd. They tucked into an alcove beneath old concert posters and vintage beer signs, it felt like their own private island. The overhead Edison bulb cast a warm, honeyed glow that seemed to soften the edges of the world around them.
As they settled into the cushions, still buzzing from dancing, Andrew was acutely aware of how Natalie's shoulder pressed against his. The leather creaked softly as she turned toward him, tucking one leg underneath herself in that characteristic way she had since freshman year. A distant part of his mind registered that they were sitting closer than usual, their knees touching, but neither made any move to create space between them.
"I can't believe we actually did that," Andrew said, his voice carrying a note of wonder. The whiskey had left a pleasant warmth in his chest, or maybe that was just the lingering effect of singing with Natalie, of watching her eyes light up as she twirled under the spotlight.
"What, the great Andrew Nolan doubting our dancing skills?" Natalie's teasing smile softened as she studied his face. 
Natalie lifted her eyes to meet his, and the vulnerability he saw there made his chest ache. The stage lights from the karaoke platform reflected in her eyes like stars, and for a moment, he was transported back to all their late-night conversations, all the times they'd stayed up until dawn, talking about everything and nothing.
Suddenly, inevitably, he found himself leaning closer. The scent of her perfume mingled with the whiskey on her breath, creating an intoxicating mixture that made his head spin. Natalie's eyes fluttered half-closed as the distance between them shrank to inches, then centimeters.
The moment stretched like honey, sweet and golden and full of promise. Andrew could feel the warmth of her breath on his lips, could see the entire universe in her irises. His free hand moved to cup her cheek, and she leaned into his touch like a flower turning toward the sun.
Just then, "Sweet Caroline" blasted through the speakers, and the entire bar erupted in a chorus of "BAH BAH BAH!" The sudden noise made them jump apart, the moment shattering like glass.
Natalie let out a shaky laugh, pressing her hands to her flushed cheeks. "I think," she said, her voice unsteady, "I think maybe we should get some air."
Andrew nodded, trying to calm his racing heart. "Yeah," he managed, standing and offering her his hand. "Air would be good."
The cool night air hit them like a splash of cold water as they stepped out of the bar. Andrew inhaled deeply, feeling the fog of alcohol and adrenaline start to clear from his mind. Beside him, Natalie shivered slightly, wrapping her arms around herself.


"Without thinking, Andrew shrugged off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders. 'Here,' he said softly.
Natalie looked up at him, surprise and gratitude mingling in her eyes. 'Thanks,' she murmured, pulling the jacket closer around her. It was too big for her, the sleeves falling past her fingertips, and Andrew felt a surge of warmth at the sight. He smiled, but the weight of the moment pressed against him. Something had shifted between them tonight.
They walked in silence, the quiet night around them almost too calm, leaving only the distant hum of traffic and the sound of their footsteps. The air felt charged, buzzing with things unsaid, possibilities hanging in the space between them.
Andrew’s thoughts tumbled, his heart racing for reasons that went beyond the buzz of alcohol. He wanted to say something, anything to address the shift. His mind flashed back to all the times he’d kept things hidden, kept his feelings at bay. This felt different—bigger.
'Was it everything you hoped for?' Natalie’s voice broke through his thoughts, her tone light, but there was something more in the way she asked.
Andrew hesitated, his mind still processing. 'It was better,' he said, his voice quieter than he intended. 'The drinks, the singing, it was all great, but...'
He trailed off, feeling exposed. His pulse quickened, his thoughts darting between all the things he wanted to say and the fear of ruining what they had.
Natalie slowed her pace, turning her head slightly to look at him. 'But what?' she asked softly, her eyes searching his face, almost as if she already knew the answer.
'It was you,' Andrew finally said, his voice barely above a whisper. 'You made it special. Being with you… it just felt right. More than I expected.'
For a moment, Natalie didn’t respond. Andrew’s heart leapt into his throat, wondering if he’d said too much. But then her hand slipped into his, her touch warm and grounding. She smiled, a soft, knowing smile that made the world around them fade.
'I’m glad,' she said, her words simple but carrying weight, as if they both knew they had crossed a line. Her fingers tightened around his, and for a brief moment, they stopped walking, standing in the quiet of the night.
Andrew’s breath caught. They were standing on the edge of something bigger than either of them had anticipated. He wasn’t sure what would happen next, but he knew things wouldn’t be the same after tonight. The possibilities ahead felt both terrifying and exciting."
The walk to Natalie's apartment was charged with anticipation. They climbed the stairs in silence, hands still linked. At her door, Natalie fumbled with her keys, her hands shaking slightly. Finally, the lock clicked open, and she turned to Andrew.
At her door, Natalie fumbled with her keys, her hands shaking slightly. The sound of metal against metal seemed too loud in the quiet hallway, too real for this moment that felt suspended between what was and what could be. Andrew watched her profile in the dim light, struck by how many times he'd stood in this exact spot, saying goodnight after movies or study sessions, always holding back, always keeping that careful distance. But tonight, the air between them felt electric, charged with years of unspoken feelings and carefully maintained boundaries that suddenly seemed paper-thin.
Finally, the lock clicked open. Natalie turned to face him, still wearing his jacket, her eyes bright with something that looked like courage and fear tangled together. "Do you want to come in?" she asked, her voice soft but determined. The question hung between them, weighted with meaning that went far beyond its simple words.
Andrew's heart pounded in his chest. He knew this was a turning point, that whatever happened next would change everything. But looking into Natalie's eyes, seeing the warmth and longing there, he found he didn't care about the consequences.


"Yes," he said simply.
As the door closed behind them, the air in the apartment seemed to thicken with anticipation. The room was familiar – he knew every piece of furniture, every framed photo, could navigate the space blindfolded if needed. But tonight, in the soft glow of the single lamp she'd left on earlier, everything felt new, unprecedented.
Natalie turned to face him, her eyes dark with desire, reflecting the dim light like stars. For a moment, they stood there, the weight of years of unspoken feelings hanging between them. Her apartment was quiet except for the distant hum of the city and the sound of their breathing, everything else falling away as if the world outside had ceased to exist.
Then, as if drawn by an irresistible force, they came together. Their lips met in a kiss that was both soft and urgent, tender and passionate – a perfect storm of longing finally set free. Years of careful friendship and suppressed emotions poured out in a torrent of sensation. Andrew's hands found her waist, pulling her closer until there was no space left between them. Natalie's fingers tangled in his hair, and she made a small sound that sent electricity coursing through his veins.
The kiss deepened, grew more heated. Natalie stepped backward, drawing him with her until her back met the wall. Andrew braced himself against it, breaking the kiss to trail his lips along the curve of her neck. She tilted her head back, a soft gasp escaping her lips that made his whole body tingle.
"Andy," she breathed, his name a prayer on her lips. Her hands slipped beneath his shirt, exploring the warm skin beneath, causing him to shiver at her touch. Every point of contact between them felt like a small explosion of sensation, years of wanting finally finding release.
When they finally paused for breath, Andrew rested his forehead against hers, their panting mingling in the scant space between them. His heart was racing, every nerve ending alive with sensation. "Nat," he whispered, his voice rough with emotion, "are you sure about this?


Natalie cupped his face in her hands, her thumbs caressing his cheekbones. Her eyes, when they met his, were clear and filled with certainty despite the flush on her cheeks and the quickened rise and fall of her chest. "I've never been more sure of anything in my life," she said softly, but with conviction. "I want you, Andy. I've always wanted you."


Their lips met again, softer this time but no less passionate. As they kissed, Natalie's hands found the hem of Andrew's shirt, tugging gently. Understanding her intent, Andrew broke away just long enough to pull the garment over his head before gathering her close again.


They moved towards the bed, shedding clothes along the way, each newly revealed expanse of skin explored with reverent touches and ardent kisses. As they fell onto the mattress together, the world outside ceased to exist. There was only this moment, this connection, the slide of skin on skin, the whisper of declarations long held secret, and the promise of a new beginning.


In the soft glow of dawn, they would face the consequences of their choices. But for now, there was only Andrew and Natalie, finally allowing themselves to love and be loved in return.
