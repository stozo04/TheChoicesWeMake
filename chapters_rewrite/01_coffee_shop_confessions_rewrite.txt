Chapter 1: Coffee Shop Confessions

The door to Brewed Awakening swung open, ushering in a crisp gust of autumn air. Andrew stepped inside, the familiar chime announcing his arrival. He tightened his grip on the strap of his messenger bag, gaze briefly catching on a worn Polaroid pinned near the entrance—him and Natalie grinning over their first cups of coffee, captioned "Study buddies forever."

Scanning the room, he spotted Natalie at their usual table by the window, sunlight turning her hair into gold. His chest tightened. Three years he'd kept his feelings hidden. Today, that would change.

He wove through tables, passing a cluttered bookshelf holding a dog-eared poetry book Natalie had jokingly given him after he'd confessed poetry baffled him. Secretly, he'd read every page.

"Andy! You're late," Natalie said, smiling brightly as he approached.

"Professor Mendez," he replied, sliding into the chair opposite her. "Another endless lecture on ethics and AI."

Natalie laughed, sliding a mug toward him. "Caramel latte, extra whip. Figured you'd need it."

He wrapped his hands around the mug. "You’re hopeless without me," she teased, rolling her eyes dramatically. "You’d still be stuck in Chem 101 if it wasn't for my flashcards."

He chuckled softly, his pulse quickening. He opened his mouth, ready to speak, but Natalie's phone buzzed sharply on the table.

She glanced down, then flipped the phone face down without answering, eyes briefly flicking toward the door as if considering an escape.

Andrew frowned gently. "Everything okay?"

Natalie hesitated, toying with the corner of her napkin. "It's Chris. He's checking on dinner tomorrow — our anniversary."

Andrew swallowed, the familiar sting tightening in his chest. "Four years, huh?"

She nodded, but her expression was guarded. "I don't know," she murmured. "Sometimes I feel like we're totally different people than we were freshman year, you know?"

His heart skipped. "Different how?"

Natalie looked up, holding his gaze longer than usual. "Like we're together because it's easier than admitting things have changed."

The café seemed suddenly quieter, the noise fading into distant murmurs. Andrew leaned forward, voice softer, decisive. "Nat, there's something I—"

Her phone buzzed once more, insistent. Natalie glanced at it, then back at Andrew, her expression torn. She could see he was trying to tell her something important.

"Andy, I..." She looked genuinely conflicted, her hand hovering over her phone. "Can we pick this up later? Chris is really spiraling about tomorrow, and if I don't call him back..." She touched his arm gently, apologetically. "But whatever you wanted to say—it's important, isn't it?"

He nodded, managing a small smile. "Yeah. But go handle Chris. We'll talk soon."

"Promise?" There was something urgent in her voice, as if she sensed the weight of what he'd been about to say.

"Promise."

She squeezed his arm once before gathering her books, moving with reluctance rather than haste. At the door, she turned back, catching his eye one more time before stepping into the afternoon.

He watched helplessly as she disappeared through the café door. Silence settled over their table, deepening the ache in his chest. Three years of holding back, three years of silence, three years pretending this was enough.

Enough.

He pulled out his phone, thumb hovering over her contact. Outside, autumn leaves drifted aimlessly, letting the breeze guide their path.

He typed quickly:

"Nat, there's something I need to tell you. Something I should have said a long time ago. Can we meet tomorrow?"

His thumb hovered over send, pulse racing.

He pressed send.

The message vanished, carrying away three years of quiet longing. Andrew slipped the phone back into his pocket and stepped out into the crisp afternoon air, heart hammering.

Tomorrow, he'd stop being afraid.

Tomorrow, he'd tell her the truth.
