Chapter 2: Unspoken Truths

Andrew woke before his alarm, his dream dissolving into fragments—golden hair, a warm smile, and the phantom taste of caramel latte. Sunlight streamed through his apartment window, painting everything in sharp relief. Today was the day.
He'd sent the text sixteen hours ago. Sixteen hours of replaying every possible outcome, from Natalie's relieved confession that she felt the same way, to the awful silence of a friendship ending. His phone sat on the nightstand like a loaded gun—three more messages from her overnight, casual and normal, as if she had no idea he was about to detonate their entire relationship.
Andrew showered, dressed, and tried to eat breakfast, but everything tasted like cardboard. How do you prepare for a conversation that could rearrange your entire world?
At 1:30, he left his apartment, giving himself extra time to walk to campus and work up his courage. The autumn air was sharp and clean, leaves crunching under his feet with each step toward his future—or his ruin.
He was so lost in rehearsing his words that he didn't see her until it was too late.
The collision was inevitable—shoulder to shoulder, books tumbling to the ground like falling stars. Andrew looked up, an apology already forming on his lips, and found himself staring into eyes that seemed to hold secrets he didn't know he needed.
"I'm so sorry, I wasn't watching where I was—"
"Hello, Andrew." Her voice was soft, knowing, as if she'd been expecting this exact moment on this exact day.
The world tilted. She knew his name. He'd never seen her before in his life, yet something about her felt achingly familiar, like a song he couldn't quite remember.
