- Their first real "couple" moment:
  * Shy smiles
  * Testing new relationship boundaries
  * The excitement of planning something as an official couple
- Andrew suggesting Italian restaurant:
  * The way his eyes light up describing it
  * How he'd been wanting to take her there for months
  * Their hands finding each other across the table
- Natalie's mixed emotions:
  * Joy at this sweet moment
