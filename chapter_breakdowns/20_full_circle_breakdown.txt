Chapter 20: Full Circle
Scene 1: Coffee at Brewed Awakenings
Setting: Brewed Awakenings Café, Morning
* Opening: Andrew sits at a familiar corner table in Brewed Awakenings, sipping coffee and waiting for his daughter. This café holds special meaning for him—it’s where he used to come during his college years with Natalie (Anna’s mom). Today, he’s meeting Anna, who is running slightly late after her morning rounds.
* Anna’s Arrival: Anna arrives, wearing her white doctor’s coat, and greets her father warmly. She orders coffee to go and then turns to Andrew with a playful smile, asking, “Are you ready for the tour of my new office?”
* Subtle Reflection: As they stand to leave, Andrew is momentarily struck by how grown up Anna looks. The way she carries herself reminds him so much of her mother, but there’s something else, something uniquely her—a strength that feels both familiar and different.
Scene 2: The Drive to the Hospital
Setting: Outside Brewed Awakenings
* Anna's Statement: As they step out of Brewed Awakenings, coffee in hand, Anna wraps her arm around Andrew and says softly, “This is where it all started.”
   * Andrew’s Initial Confusion: Andrew assumes she’s referring to the hospital or her new residency, thinking that perhaps she means her medical career is just beginning. He smiles, feeling a surge of pride, and asks, “Your residency?”
   * Anna’s Knowing Smile: Starts laughing - throws her purse on the ground and kneels next to it.. “Do you recognize this?”
   * Andrew’s Confusion: Andrew is confused, glancing around at students walking by. Anna - Are you ok? Your nerves getting the best of you”. He doesn’t remember anything special about this place.
   * Anna’s Reveal: Anna smiles and says “This look – It doesn’t ring any bells.. As if.. I dont know.. Someone knocked me over as they were walking and not paying attention.”
   * The Moment of Realization: As Anna talks, the pieces start to click into place for Andrew. He remembers the day clearly - leaving the cafe with his heart in his hands – then suddenly bumping into…. Her.. His.. Anna”
   * Andrew’s Realization: He begins to understand that everything—his decisions in college, Anna’s presence, and even Jill’s legacy—has been interconnected. Time, love, and choices have all come full circle, leading them to this moment.
      * The choice to not get on the flight
      * The lottery
   * Anna’s Gratitude: Anna thanks her father for trusting her, for always choosing the right path, and for believing in love over everything else. Her words carry a deeper meaning now that Andrew understands the full scope of what she’s done for him and their family.








Scene 3: The Hospital
Setting: Inside Jill Nolan Memorial University Hospital
* Hospital Tour: Anna leads Andrew through the hospital, pointing out various wings and sections as they walk. Her pride is evident, but there’s something more in her demeanor—something deeper that Andrew can’t quite place.
Scene 4: Jill’s Portrait
Setting: Hospital Atrium, Facing Jill Nolan’s Portrait
Final Moment:
Setting: The Atrium, as Anna prepares to leave
* Ending: Anna’s pager beeps, signaling that her duties as a doctor await. She hugs Andrew fiercely, and as she pulls away, she gives him one last knowing look, filled with gratitude and love.
* Closing Line: As Andrew watches her walk away, he reflects on the journey they’ve taken together, realizing that love, time, and family are all connected in ways he never understood before.
   * Final line: "Some choices echo through time, creating ripples we can’t see until they come full circle. And sometimes, just sometimes, those ripples send back angels to guide us home."
