(Drops between current Ch 13 Dreams & Sacrifices and Ch 14 The Flight That Never Was)

Main Plot Points
Internship High 
Andrew meets Professor Mendez in the engineering café. They discuss boarding-pass details and housing in Austin; Mendez hands over a congratulatory letter.

Campus Weather Alert 
Phones buzz—severe-storm advisory for tomorrow’s flights. Mendez shrugs it off as “just spring in Texas.”

Anna’s Silent Appearance 
Exiting the café, Andrew spots Anna across the quad, standing in swirling leaves. She only taps her wrist—time—then points at the blackening sky before vanishing behind library arches.

Doubt Over Dinner 
Andrew cancels celebratory pizza with friends, retreating to his dorm. He prints his boarding pass yet hesitates to pack.

Late-Night Call with Natalie 
Natalie, voice shaky from morning sickness she still calls “the flu,” urges him to pursue his dream. The call ends on a lingering “Be safe.”

Storm-lit Reflection 
Alone, Andrew watches lightning crawl over the horizon, fingering the carved “A+N” key fob on his backpack. He whispers, “What if the sign is to stay…?”

Character Focus (Main)
Andrew – Torn between long-fought ambition and a gut sense that Natalie needs him; first serious wavering about the trip.

Supporting Characters
Professor Mendez – Academic cheerleader; frames internship as once-in-a-lifetime.

Natalie (voice-only) – Underscores Andrew’s internal tug-of-war.

Anna – Wordless but urgent, heightening suspense.

Themes & Conflicts
Dream vs. Duty – Career milestone collides with rising family obligations.

Interpreting Signs – Is the storm coincidence or destiny’s nudge?

Time Pressure – Boarding pass timestamps amplify urgency.

Symbolic Elements
Storm Front – Physical mirror of Andrew’s inner turbulence.

Boarding Pass – Tangible fork in the road.

Key Fob with “A+N” – Love anchoring him to home.

Setting
Bustling engineering café → darkening quad → quiet dorm room with storm flicker at the window.

Chapter-Ending Hook
Thunder cracks; power blinks out. In the sudden darkness Andrew’s phone lights up with a single push alert: “Flight 887: Weather Impact – early check-in recommended.” He exhales, “Early… or never?”

Narrative Techniques
Storm-sound leitmotif – Rain on windows crescendos whenever Andrew’s doubt spikes.

Minimalist Anna – No dialogue, only gestures, to keep mystique taut.

Board-pass close-ups – Visual motif in prose (seat 27A, 7 a.m. boarding).

Character Development
Andrew graduates from unwavering excitement to genuine conflict—first moment he contemplates choosing people over a lifelong dream.

Unresolved Questions
Will Andrew interpret the storm and Anna’s gesture as a clear “don’t go”?

How much does Natalie’s wavering voice influence his choice?

What additional “sign” might push him over the edge by dawn?

Potential Future Developments
A final campus landmark (clock-tower chimes) could echo in the airport scene.

Professor Mendez’s signed letter may reappear as a bittersweet memento after Andrew stays.
