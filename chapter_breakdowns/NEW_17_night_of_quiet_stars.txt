(Slots between current Ch 17 Loss & Legacy funeral scene and the lottery-donation reveal)

Main Plot Points
After-Funeral Silence
Evening falls on the Nolan farmhouse; condolence crowds are gone, leaving dishes in the sink and wilted flowers on the table.

Porch with Grandpa Jim
Andrew joins Jim on the creaking swing. Jim breaks the silence with a war-time anecdote about “finding the North Star when everything felt lost.”

The Lottery Ticket Resurfaces
Andrew’s wallet drops; the folded paper with Anna’s numbers flutters out. Jim notices but says nothing—just raises an eyebrow that says, “Heavy, isn’t it?”

Stargazing & Jill’s Memory
They spot the bright evening star Jill once called her “heavenly night-light.” Andrew whispers, “Hi, Mom,” and feels simultaneous ache and calm.

Natalie’s Quiet Entrance
Wrapped in Jill’s old cardigan, Natalie brings cocoa, sits beside Andrew, and rests his hand on her rounding belly. Three generations under one sky.

Decision Forming
Andrew confides the winning ticket and his dread of what sudden wealth could do. Jim responds, “Money’s just a tool, son—same as a rifle or a scalpel. It’s what you aim it at.”

Final Resolve
Andrew stares at the star, folds the ticket into an envelope, and writes For Mom—turn this into hope. He seals it before he can second-guess.
