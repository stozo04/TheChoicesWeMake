Epilogue: Full Circle


Setting: The Campus Bench, Years Later
- Quiet autumn evening
- Andrew sitting alone at first
- Tracing the old "A&N" carving
- Reflecting on the journey:
  * The pretzel sign that saved his life
  * The daughter who guided him through time
  * The choices that shaped their family
  * His mother's legacy living on through the hospital


The moment:
- Anna joining him (now an established doctor)
- Both of them sitting where everything began
- She takes his hand, places it on her stomach
- "Dad, I'm pregnant."
- The cycle beginning again
- Understanding passing between them:
  * Some loves transcend time
  * Some choices echo forever
  * Some stories never really end


Final image:
- As they sit together, a young couple passes by
- The girl looking lost, uncertain
- Anna's knowing smile
- Because she understands now:
  * Sometimes we need guidance to find our way
  * Sometimes love sends us back to light the path
  * Sometimes the best stories are the ones that loop back to the beginning
