(Follows Chapter 18 Graduation; slides between graduation and epilogue material)

Main Plot Points
Summer Nesting
Three months post-graduation. Natalie and Andrew tour a tiny rental house near campus; peeling paint, but plenty of sunlight for a nursery. Lease signed on the spot.

Building a Life
Montage week: Andrew assembles a crib while Natalie paints sunrise-hued walls (soft peach to pale gold). Grandpa Jim drops off Jill’s rocking chair; Sarah appears with a box of baby books.

Courthouse Wedding
On a warm Friday morning, five guests—Jim, Sarah, and Natalie’s parents—gather at the county building. Andrew’s voice cracks on “for better, for worse,” Natalie steadies his hand on the final “I do.”

Benchside Vows
Instead of rings exchange inside, they walk to the campus bench with the carved “A + N.” There, under dusk light, they slip simple silver bands onto each other while baby kicks against Natalie’s dress.

Quiet Celebration
Backyard cookout at Jim’s: lemonade, fireflies, and Natalie dancing barefoot to an old vinyl of “Here Comes the Sun.” Andrew hums the melody against her shoulder.

Night-Before Countdown
Later that evening, Andrew can’t sleep. He sits in the half-finished nursery, writing a letter to his unborn daughter about “all the little signs that brought us here.”

First Flutter Shared
Natalie joins him, guiding his hand. They both feel a distinct roll—first shared movement. Tears, laughter, and whispered promise: “See you at sunrise, little one.”
